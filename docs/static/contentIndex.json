Players and Game Masters (GMs) are provided tools to create their own adventures anywhere in Tamriel—or beyond.\nGroups can decide how to use these rules to craft unique stories. While many campaigns may take place during the Third or Fourth Era, the system allows freedom to explore any age or continent.\n\nWhat’s New in Third Edition\nThird Edition polished and streamlined the core ideas of Second Edition, simplifying mechanics, improving balance, and enhancing clarity. The system is easier to learn while staying true to Elder Scrolls lore.\nLore, Design, and Canon\nUESRPG aims to honor the spirit of Elder Scrolls lore while filling in gaps left by the games. The designers built a coherent tabletop interpretation of the setting, reconciling contradictions and gameplay abstractions.\nCanon within the Elder Scrolls is intentionally fluid; this system provides a solid foundation that can be adapted to each group’s preferred version of Tamriel.\nUsing this Book\nThis compendium includes all rules needed to create characters and play within the Elder Scrolls setting. It assumes basic familiarity with tabletop RPGs.\nThree books form the core of the system: the Rules Compendium, Player’s Handbook, and GM Handbook. Seven supplements further expand the rules: Arcane Arts, Planes of Oblivion, Tamrielic Artifacts, Secrets of the Dwemer, Inhabitants of Tamriel, Heroes of Tamriel, and Dark Paths.\n\nVersion 4 Addendum\nTo preserve the recorded intent and vision of the original designers, Seht’s introduction from the Core Rulebook remains intact. However, many supplements and editions followed, and Version 4 (v4) seeks to unify them.\nAn Abridged History of 3rd Edition\nThe first version of 3e was discovered online and improved through multiple revisions: v2, v3, and the Black Book of Apocrypha. These versions expanded upon the Core Rulebook, adding rules for conjuration, necromancy, elite advances, and more.\nThe community split between v2 and v3 preferences until Greybard and the v4 team began consolidating the system. Their goal was to merge the best aspects of each, returning to the spirit of the original while improving playability.\nThe v4 Vision\nVersion 4 consolidates ten supplements into three books: this Rules Compendium, Inhabitants of Tamriel (NPCs), and Tamrielic Artifacts (relics and magical items). Its foundation is v2 with errata, enhanced by select rules from later editions and the Black Book.\nKey Changes &amp; Additions\nMajor revisions include:\n\n\nReintroduction of Wound Thresholds (with an Alternate Wounds option)\n\n\nRemoval of Armored Spellcasting Penalties\n\n\nRestoration of v2 Action Point Refreshing\n\n\nStreamlined Enchanting rules\n\n\nRevised Bleeding, Disease, Vampirism, Lycanthropy, and Shadow Magic mechanics\n\n\nAdjustments to spell costs, casting conditions, and balance\n\n\n\nTable of Contents – Quick Navigation\n\n\n01 - Chapter 1 - Getting Started\n\n\n02 - Chapter 2 - Character Creation\n\n\n03 - Chapter 3 - Skills\n\n\n04 - Chapter 4 - Talents and Traits\n\n\n05 - Chapter 5 - Advanced Mechanics\n\n\n06 - Chapter 6 - Magic\n\n\n07 - Chapter 7 - Economics and Equipment\n\n\n08 - Chapter 8 - Elite Advances\n\n\n09 - Appendix\n\n"},"Vampirism-Rework":{"slug":"Vampirism-Rework","filePath":"Vampirism Rework.md","title":"Vampirism Rework","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"🩸 The Curse of Thirst\n\n“The blood remembers. The longer you deny it, the louder it calls.”\n\n\n⚙️ Infection\nWhenever a creature takes damage from a Vampire’s Bite attack, they must succeed a –10 Endurance Test or become infected.\nIf they are fed the blood of a vampire, they automatically fail this test.\n\n🧠 The Thirst\nEach night at sundown, a vampire must make a Willpower Test or suffer +1 Thirst level.\nThe DC increases by +10 per night since the last feeding.\nEach stage of Thirst replaces the previous one and adds its cumulative penalties.\n\n🌙 Stages of Thirst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStageConditionEffectsWell FedFed within the last 24 hours.• Natural healing rate doubled.  • You benefit from Short and Long Rests normally.  • Gain +10 Personality when interacting with mortals.SatedFed within 2 days.• No penalties.  • Can still rest normally.Thirsty3–4 days since feeding.• Haunted by blood dreams.  • –10 to Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality Tests.  • You cannot benefit from Short or Long Rests.Parched5–6 days.• –20 to mental tests.  • Sunlight and holy damage doubled.  • +1 Corruption per day.Dry7–8 days.• –40 total penalty to mental Tests.  • Gain +1 Max SP and +10 to Damage Tests.  • Appearance becomes clearly monstrous.Ravenous9–10 days.• As Dry, plus an additional +1 Max SP.  • Automatically fail Willpower Tests to resist feeding when blood is present.Feral11+ days.• Lose all control; attack the nearest living creature until “Sated.”  • After rampage, make a Willpower (Hard –20) Test or gain a Corruption Effect.\n\n☀️ Sunlight &amp; Mortal Mask\nAll Vampire Bloodlines share the Mortal Mask trait, representing their ability to appear mortal when well-fed.\nMortal Mask (Universal Vampiric Trait)\n\nWhile Well Fed or Sated, your vampiric nature lies dormant beneath the skin.\nYour eyes, breath, and heartbeat return faintly. You pass as living to all but divine senses.\n\n\n\nYou do not take Sunlight damage while Well Fed or Sated.\n\n\nDetect Life, Turn Undead, and most Divination magic treat you as mortal.\n\n\nWhen you become Thirsty or worse, your Mask fades and sunlight burns you again.\n\n\n\n🧬 Vampire Bloodlines\n\n“All vampires share the same curse, but not the same hunger.”\n\n\n🩸 Aundae — Arcane Blood\nThe mage clans of Morrowind, whose blood thrums with sorcery.\nStat Modifiers: +5 Str, +10 Wp, +5 Prc, +5 Prs\nPassive Trait — Arcane Blood: Gain the Power Well (10) trait.\nNotes: Aundae vampires can store immense Magicka reserves and favor Hemomancy or Illusion. Many still dwell in ancestral tombs under House Telvanni influence.\n\n🩸 Berne — Unseen, Unheard, Unknown\nSilent predators of the night, striking from darkness and shadow.\nStat Modifiers: +5 Str, +10 Ag, +5 Prc, +5 Prs\nPassive Trait — Shadow Hunter: Gain the Chameleon (-10) trait while in dim light, darkness, or crowded areas.\nNotes: Berne vampires are ambushers and assassins. They feed sparingly and vanish without trace, often using illusion to blend among prey.\n\n🩸 Cyrodilic — Lords of the Scarlet Veil\nThe hidden nobility of Tamriel, masters of charm and deceit.\nStat Modifiers: +5 Str, +5 Wp, +5 Prc, +10 Prs\nPassive Trait — Mortal Mask:\nIgnore damage from the Dawn-Cursed trait.\nWhile in direct sunlight and not sufficiently covered, your maximum AP is reduced by 1.\nObserve or Investigate tests to discern your vampiric nature suffer a –50 penalty.\nUnique Bloodline Ability — The Scarlet Veil:\n\n“In every lie, truth hides its teeth.”\nOnce per day, as a Reaction, you may turn a failed Personality Test against a mortal into a success, revealing subtle supernatural charm.\nWhen you feed without killing, you may attempt to erase the victim’s memory with an opposed Willpower Test.\n\nNotes: Cyrodilic vampires are the most integrated among mortals, often holding positions of wealth or political influence in the Empire.\n\n🩸 Quarra — Vigor of the Grave\nThe ancient warlords of the west, their strength unbroken even in death.\nStat Modifiers: +5 Str, +10 End, +5 Ag, +5 Prc\nPassive Trait — Vigor of the Grave: Gain +1 Maximum Stamina Point (SP).\nNotes: Quarra are physical powerhouses, often preferring open combat and bloodletting to subtlety. They despise weakness and revere Molag Bal’s cruelty.\n\n🩸 Volkihar — Ice Walker\nReclusive vampires from Skyrim’s frozen north, cold as the glaciers they haunt.\nStat Modifiers: +5 Str, +5 End, +5 Ag, +5 Prc, +5 Prs\nPassive Trait — Ice Walker: You can freely walk through solid ice as though it were not there.\nIf you end your turn within ice, you take 2d8 damage (ignores AR) at the end of each turn.\nNotes: Volkihar vampires are solitary and monstrous, their hunger reflected in the frost they command. Many possess control over ice and bone.\n\n🧾 Gameplay Summary\n\n\nAll vampires now follow the same feeding mechanics via the Curse of Thirst system.\n\n\nEach bloodline remains distinct through its passive trait and unique stat bonuses.\n\n\nThe Cyrodilic Scarlet Veil makes them manipulative aristocrats, not sunlight-immune outliers.\n\n\nMortal Mask ensures all vampires are playable and sustainable without nightly feeding.\n\n"},"Appendix/Appendix":{"slug":"Appendix/Appendix","filePath":"Appendix/Appendix.md","title":"Appendix","links":["tags/homebrew-channel"],"tags":["homebrew-channel"],"content":"Appendix\nSpell MakinG referenCe\nThe reference materials in this section are for players to use to\ncreate their own spells. See Unconventional Spells in Chapter\n6 for details.\nSpell Attributes\nMany spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify\ntheir rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The rules\nfor spell attributes apply to all types of spells but are included\nin this section for convenience:\nAttack: Using this effect is considered an Attack for the\npurposes of determining Attacks per round. Requires a\nPrimary Cast Magic Action to cast.\nInstant: This spell can be cast using a Secondary Action,\npermitting the caster to either cast the spell on their turn\nor as a Reaction outside of their turn.\nPotion: A potion can be created with this spell effect.\nToxin: A toxin can be created with this spell effect.\n  Upkeep: The caster can, as a free action, refresh the effect \n\n(including any required tests or rolls, not including the\ncasting test, using the original target(s)) and duration of\nthis spell when it ends by paying the original cost that they\npaid for the spell as long as the requirements for the spell\n(like range) are still met. If the spell has no listed duration,\nthen the character cannot upkeep the spell if they have cast\na different spell since the original cast. If a spell has the\nAttack attribute, then upkeeping the spell counts toward\nthe maximum attacks per round limit.\nOverload: The caster benefits from an extra effect (as spec-\nified) if not restraining this spell.\nReinforce: By default, spells with this attribute have no\nextra effects. When a character takes the Mage Guard and\nthe Arcane Defender talents, they benefit from a bonus to\nthe spell effect if not restraining the spell.\nRanged (range): Spell can affect a target within the listed\nrange.\nMelee (range): Spell counts as melee with the listed range.\nDoes not provoke attacks of opportunity.\nDirect: This spell has a target or targets. These kinds of\nspells cannot do damage and cannot be defended against\nby normal means.\nSpell Forms\nThis page contains a list of spell forms.  A Form is the shape\nof the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fireball,\nwhich uses the ball form) while others are cast only on the\ncaster themselves (the self  form). Most spell form have a base\ncost associated with them and a single parameter (which is\nrepresented by the variable Z) to determine their size. Many\nalso have attributes associated with them: these are imparted\nto the final spell.\nSelf\nPotion\nCost: 1\nAffects the caster.\n  AoE (range, form): This spell counts as a ranged area of \n\neffect of the given form/radius.\nMindlock (X): Reduces the casters max AP by X to a\nminimum of zero.\n[Variation]: This spell has multiple variations, each cor-\nresponding to one of the listed items. Each variation is its\nown spell that must be learned separately.\nTouch\nRanged (1m)\nCost: 1\nAffects a single target character within 1m of the caster.\nBolt\nRanged (100m)\nCost: 2\n238\n\fAffects a single target character within 100m of the caster.\nTarget\nDirect\nCost: 4\nAffects a single target character within 50m of the caster. If this\nspell would alter the Targets mind or harm them in any way,\nthis form becomes a Direct Attack.\nBall\nRanged, AoE (1 + Zm, sphere)\nCost: 5 + Z\nAffects all targets within 1 + Z meters of target point within\n100m of the caster.\nBeam\nRanged, AoE (10 + 10*Zm, beam)\nCost: 5 + Z\nAffects all targets within a 1m wide line 10 + (10 x Z) meters\nin chosen direction from the caster.\nChain\nRanged (50m)\nCost: 5 + Z\nAffects a single target within 50m of the caster. Then affects up\nto Z additional targets of the caster’s choice, each within 10m\nof the previous target.\nCloak\nUpkeep\nCost: 4\nAffects all targets within 1m at the end of each of the casters\nturns. This Form ignores the Attack attribute at GM discretion.\nCone\nAoE (3 + Zm, cone)\nCost: 5 + Z\nAffects all targets within a 3 + Z meter cone (a cone with a\nlength of 3 + Z meters, and the same width).\nPulse\nAoE (1 + Zm, sphere)\nCost: 4 + Z\nAffects all targets within 1 + Z meters of the caster.\nRune\nCost: 5 + Z\nCreates a magical rune that takes up 1 square meter on a surface\nwithin 1 meter. After a 1 round delay the rune becomes barely\nvisible (-20 to any vision based tests to spot it). The caster\nchooses one or more conditions upon which the rune detonates.\nThe rune persists indefinitely.\nProximity: The rune detonates whenever a character comes \n\nwithin a certain distance (chosen by the caster).\nTime: The rune detonates after a set amount of time.\nManual: The caster can detonate the rune manually from\nany distance by using the Cast Magic action.\nWhen the rune detonates it affects all targets within 1 + Z meters.\nThis counts as an area of effect attack and can be evaded, but\nonly if a character is aware of the rune.\nThis Form ignores the Attack attribute at GM discretion.\nStorm\nUpkeep, AoE (1 + (3 x Z), sphere), (loses the Overload\nattribute)\nCost: 5 + Z\nAffects all targets within 1 + (3 x Z) meters of target point within\n100m. Leaves behind a persistent zone in this area for 1 round\nthat causes the same effect to any characters who pass through\nit (or end their turn in it if they started there). Upkeeping the\nspell does not let the caster move the storm, it merely refreshes\nthe effect and duration.\nWall\nUpkeep, AoE (Z, wall)\nCost: 5 + Z\nCreates a wall 1m wide and 1 + (2 x Z) meters long within 100m,\nwith an orientation chosen by the caster. Affects all targets within\nthe area of the wall. Leaves behind a persistent zone in this area\nfor 1 round that causes the same effect to any characters who\nenter it (or end their turn in it if they started there). Upkeeping\nthe spell does not let the caster move the wall, it merely refreshes\nthe effect and duration.\nSpell Effects\nThe next page contains a list of spell effects.  An Effect is the\nactual content of a spell: the fire effect causes fire damage while\nthe heal effect heals it.\nMost spell effects have a cost determined by a static multiplier\ntimes the chosen spell level (SL). Many also have attributes\nassociated with them: these are imparted to the final spell.\nUnless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack with\nthemselves (multiple fortify spells do not stack on top of\none another, for example).\nIf the character is casting a multi-part spell, then resolve each\npart of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the parts\nbenefit from the effects of any of the other parts).\n239\n\fEffect\nRules\nAlteration Spell Effects\nElemental Armor\nAffected target gains SL AR of the chosen [type] for 1 minute.\nMagic Armor\nAffected target gains SL magic AR for 1 minute.\nArmor\nAffected target gains SL AR for 1 minute.\nBurden\nFeather\nShield\nMagic Shield\n[Type] Shield\nAffected target must make a Strength test with a 30 - (10 x SL)\nmodifier or raise its Encumbrance level by one for 1 round.\nThis spell effect can stack and each instance of this spell is\nupkept separately.\nAffected target lowers its Encumbrance level by one for 1 round\nand treats its armor as being one weight class lighter (target\ncounts as being trained to wear this type of armor even if they\nnormally would not be).\nNote: This effect always counts as being Spell Level 3.\nTarget character within 50m of the caster gains a magical barrier\nwith SL HP that envelopes them and protects against physical\ndamage for 1 round. Any damage the caster takes from this\ndamage type reduces the barriers HP first.\nThis barriers HP does not belong to the target, but rather is\nthe HP of the barrier before it breaks. If any of the barriers HP\nremains at the end of the duration, then the spell does not cost\nMP to upkeep and the barriers HP refreshes entirely. Otherwise,\nif all the HP of the barrier is lost at the end of the duration, then\nthe spell cannot be refreshed via upkeep and must be cast again.\nTarget character within 50m of the caster gains a magical barrier\nwith [Spell Strength] HP that envelopes them and protects\nagainst magical damage for 1 round.

A player rolls two ten-sided dice—one for the tens digit and one for the ones digit. The goal is to roll equal to or under your target number (TN), which is determined by a relevant Attribute or Skill.\nExample of a Roll\n\n\n                  \n                  Skill Check Example \n                  \n                \n\nA character attempts to break down a wooden door. Their Strength (STR) is 42, so their Target Number (TN) is 42. If they roll 42 or less on a d100, they succeed.\n\n\nCriticals and Fumbles\n\n\nCritical Success: A roll of 01–05 (or 1/20th of your TN if lower) is a critical success.\n\n\nCritical Failure: A roll of 96–100 (or 5% above your TN) is a critical failure.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Degrees of Success (DoS) \n                  \n                \n\nThe number of tens by which your roll is under your TN determines your Degree of Success. For example:\n\n\nRoll 37 against TN 42 → 0 DoS (bare success)\n\n\nRoll 22 against TN 42 → 2 DoS\n\n\nRoll 03 against TN 42 → 3 DoS (critical success)\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty Levels\nThe GM assigns a Difficulty Modifier (DM) to checks based on circumstances. This modifies the TN before rolling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficultyModifierExampleVery Easy+30Reading a clearly written noteEasy+20Climbing a ladderRoutine+10Conversing in your native tongueStandard+0Average task under normal conditionsChallenging-10Picking a basic lockHard-20Tracking in rainVery Hard-30Jumping across a wide gapExtreme-40Hacking Imperial security systemsNearly Impossible-50Deflecting an arrow mid-air\n\n\n                  \n                  GM Guidance \n                  \n                \n\nAlways consider the narrative context before assigning a modifier. Tasks performed under duress or poor conditions may warrant additional penalties.\n\n\nOpposed Tests\nWhen two characters act directly against one another, both roll against their TNs. The character with the higher Degrees of Success wins the contest.\n\n\n                  \n                  Opposed Roll Example \n                  \n                \n\nA thief (Sneak 45) attempts to hide from a guard (Perception 38). Both roll: the thief gets 27 (2 DoS), the guard rolls 19 (1 DoS). The thief wins, remaining unseen.\n\n\nCooperative Tests\nSometimes multiple characters work together on a task. Each participant rolls; the highest Degree of Success applies, with +10 per additional helper who succeeded.\n\n\n                  \n                  Cooperation Example \n                  \n                \n\nThree scholars (Lore 52, 47, and 33) research a rare spell. Two succeed; one gets 1 DoS and the other 2 DoS. The team counts as 3 DoS total for the effort.\n\n\nLuck Points\nLuck Points allow players to influence the outcome of rolls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseCostDescriptionRe-roll1Re-roll a failed check, keeping the new resultModify1Add or subtract 10 from a single rollAvoid Death2Negate a killing blow, left at 1 HP\n\n\n                  \n                  Luck Point Refresh \n                  \n                \n\nLuck refreshes at the GM’s discretion—usually at the end of a session or major story milestone.\n\n\nTime and Turns\nGame time in UESRPG is divided into rounds, turns, and narrative time.\n\n\nRound: ~6 seconds of in-game time, used in combat.\n\n\nTurn: The time it takes a character to perform one action during a round.\n\n\nNarrative Time: Flexible, used outside combat to cover travel, downtime, or dialogue.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Time Example \n                  \n                \n\nCombat begins as a Daedra appears. Each round represents about 6 seconds; after four rounds, only 24 seconds have passed in-world.\n\n\nSummary of Core Mechanics\n\n\nRoll percentile dice for actions.\n\n\nAim to roll equal or lower than your TN.\n\n\nApply Difficulty Modifiers for environmental factors.\n\n\nDetermine Degrees of Success for result quality.\n\n\nUse Opposed and Cooperative tests where applicable.\n\n\nSpend Luck Points to shift fate in your favor.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Remember \n                  \n                \n\nThe numbers serve the story, not the other way around. Rolls exist to create tension, resolve uncertainty, and inspire roleplay outcomes.\n\n"},"Chapter_2_Character_Creation/Chapter_2_Character_Creation":{"slug":"Chapter_2_Character_Creation/Chapter_2_Character_Creation","filePath":"Chapter_2_Character_Creation/Chapter_2_Character_Creation.md","title":"Chapter_2_Character_Creation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 2: Character Creation\nAh yes, weve been expecting you! Youll have to be recorded before youre officially released. There are a few\nways we can do this, and the choice is yours.\nSocucius Ergalla, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n\fLegendary heroes fill the history of the Elder Scrolls setting,\nbut even the greatest heroes need to start somewhere. The\r\nworld of Tamriel is a vast and diverse one, and there are an\r\nenormous number of potential characters a player may want to\r\ncreate. However there are some things that all characters have\r\nin common, and it is on this common ground that we can start\r\nto build up a new character.\nStep 5: Finishing Touches\r\nFinally, calculate your characters attributes and finalize any\r\nremaining aspects of the character sheet. Characters also start\r\nwith a budget of drakes which can be used in this step to pur-\r\nchase equipment and other items that the character will begin\r\nthe game with. Once youve fleshed out your character and\r\nchosen your characters bonds, youre good to go!\nCharacter creation and advancement is accomplished through\r\nthe use of experience points, or XP.\nStandard character creation is a five step process. It is neces-\r\nsary to go through these steps in the correct order, and it is\r\nrecommended you read through this list before moving on in\r\norder to inform your future decisions. When you actually start\r\nbuilding the character, write down the details from each step on\r\na character sheet as you go along so you dont lose track of things.\nStep 1: Race\r\nDuring this step you will choose your characters race. In addi-\r\ntion to  the core playable races from the video games, we have\r\nalso provided various races from the lore in this book. You\r\nshould ask your GM which era the game is taking place in and\r\nwhich races are allowed for the campaign before you choose one\r\nfor your character. Each race comes with their own characteristic\r\nbaseline used to generate characteristics for members of that\r\nrace, and many races have bonus powers, starting skills, or traits.\nStep 2: Generate Characteristics\r\nDuring this step you will get to choose your characters favored\r\ncharacteristics and generate your characteristic scores using dice\r\nand the characteristic baseline appropriate to your choice of\r\nrace in the previous step.\nStep 3: Determine Birthsign\r\nNext, you determine your characters Birthsign, choosing the\r\ncharge of the Warrior, Mage, or Thief and then rolling on the\r\nappropriate table. There is a chance during this step that the\r\ncharacter will receive the Star-Cursed version of a sign instead,\r\nreflecting the threatening presence of the Serpent sign at the\r\ntime of their birth.\nStep 4: Spend XP &amp; Purchase Items\r\nNext, you spend your remaining XP on any character advance-\r\nments that you desire. Any XP remaining after this process is\r\nover is kept after character creation.\nStep 6: (Optional) Choose Character Traits\r\nYour GM may instruct you to choose Character Traits from\r\nthe section in this chapter of the same name. Here, you will\r\nchoose positive and/or negative traits using a budget defined\r\nby the book/your GM.\r\noptiMizinG CharaCterS\nAs you create your character, you may have questions about how\r\nyou can make your character function well in the context of\r\nthe game. This section will act as a guide during the character\r\ncreation process to answer those questions.\nOne of the most important parts of this process is to gather as\r\nmuch information as possible, both from your GM and the other\r\nplayers. Even if your GM cant give away particular details of the\r\ncampaign, they should be able to give you a sense of the overall\r\ntone, as well as what kinds of skills will be important to have.\r\nIts also important to talk to your fellow players, particularly\r\nwhile building your characters, so that you can make sure your\r\nparty as a whole is capable of taking on a variety of challenges\r\nand that each member has an important job to do.\nPriorities\r\nWhen building your character its important to determine what\r\nyour priorities are: what are your characters most important\r\ntraits, and how are you going to represent them within the\r\nsystem? Youre working with a limited budget of XP, and while\r\nyou might have an idea of where you want the character to go in\r\nthe future youll likely find that you have to focus on purchasing\r\nonly the essentials at first.\nMagically oriented characters should ensure that they have\r\nenough Magicka Points to support the types of spells they want\r\nto cast, and a high enough Willpower to reliably cast them.\r\nThe best way to increase ones Magicka Points is through the\r\nuse of the Power Well trait, a trait that increases the amount\r\nof ones Magicka Points and that can be attained as both a\r\nracial bonus or through the use of certain Birthsigns. Though\r\nfor some characters there may be no need for lots of magicka:\r\na high Intelligence will suffice for an Alchemist or Enchanter.\n25\n\fSurviving Combat\r\nEven characters who shine off the battlefield can expect to find\r\nthemselves in combat at least once during a campaign. It is\r\nimportant for every character to have a plan when things get\r\nviolent. Perhaps the most important thing to remember when\r\napproaching combat is to not bite off more than you can chew:\r\nfighting outnumbered is a very dangerous prospect, even for\r\nskilled warriors. There are ways to prepare for this situation,\r\nhowever: clever use of flanking and long Reach weapons, or\r\nproficiency in the Evade skill can allow a character to survive in\r\ncombat against many enemies, while heavy armor and healing\r\nmagic can allow characters to last longer under pressure.\nCharacters who have neither the ability to effectively fight in\r\nheavy armor, or the speed to dance around their foes, will benefit\r\nmost from simply not getting caught in a direct engagement.\r\nCharacters wielding ranged weapons or using ranged magic can\r\nhave a profound impact on the fight from a safe distance, where\r\nthere is a much lower risk of having an axe buried in ones skull.\r\nCore raCeS\nThe races provided in this section encompass the core races\r\nportrayed in the Elder Scrolls games. Additional races can be\r\nfound in Expanded Races on page 42. Each race comes with\r\ntheir own characteristic baseline used to generate characteristics\r\nfor members of that race, and many races have bonus powers,\r\nstarting skills, or traits. You should ask your GM which races\r\nare allowed in the campaign before you pick one.\nSome races have unique racial traits that are defined in their\r\nsections. Racial powers can be found in the Powers section later\r\nin this Chapter.\nCombat oriented characters should think about how their\r\ncharacter fights. This means considering both how they plan\r\nto engage and defeat their enemies in combat, as well as how\r\nthey plan to survive combat.\nCharacters that arent naturally tough will need another way to\r\nmitigate damage, either through magical means, the use of armor,\r\nor evasion. When it comes to winning the fight, its important\r\nto consider how your character will position themselves relative\r\nto the rest of the party: having a front line can be veryuseful\r\nif certain characters intend to engage at range, though these\r\nfront-liners will often find themselves fighting outnumbered.\nThere are also a wide variety of non-combat oriented characters\r\nthat one might wish to create. There are too many to cover\r\nhere, but in general it is still important to consider how these\r\ncharacters will handle themselves if the party gets into a fight.\nSkill and Talents\r\nThe UESRPG 3e has a large number of skills and talents that\r\nplayers can choose from when creating their characters, which\r\ncan lead to some difficult choices. Fortunately there are a few\r\ngeneral guidelines that players can follow when navigating\r\ncharacter creation.\nWhen it comes to skills, its important to decide how specialized\r\nyour character needs to be. Mages dedicated to one particular\r\nschool of magic, or warriors devoted to a specific way of combat,\r\nwould both benefit from having a high rank in the relevant skill.\r\nRogue type characters, on the other hand, can adopt a more\r\njack of all trades approach as they need to be able to navigate\r\na wide variety of situations.\nThere are also a number of non-combat skills that every char-\r\nacter should consider learning, even if only at a very low level.\r\nSkills like Observe, Survival, Lore, Ride, Navigate, Profession:\r\nMedicine and Athletics are extremely useful for all types of\r\ntraveling adventurers.\nTalents are a little more difficult to choose: there are a variety\r\nof talents that have very powerful effects, but its easy to go\r\noverboard. Some talents unlock the ability to do things that\r\nother characters cannot, while others function to augment a\r\nparticular skill (such as by providing rerolls or replacing degrees\r\nof success).\nThe critical decision is which of these abilities are necessary\r\nto the character, and which are just nice to have. The former\r\nare worth investing in early, while it is often better to replace\r\nthe latter with additional skill ranks that will prove critical at\r\nlower XP values.\n26\n\fAltmer\r\nThe Altmer (or High Elves, as they are also known) are a race\r\nof Mer that make their home on the Summerset Isles, a set of\r\nislands off the south western coast of Tamriel. Many races of\r\nTamriel consider the Altmer to be quite beautiful due to their\r\nfair, golden skinned complexion and the dazzling gem like colors\r\nof their eyes; as such, the Altmer are welcome guests in most\r\nparts of Tamriel, save for the Black Marsh and Vvardenfell.\nHowever, the combination of their fair appearance, long lives,\r\npropensity for magic, and resemblance to the Old Elves of\r\nTamriel tends to give Altmer an elevated sense of their own\r\nimportance. This can sometimes impact diplomatic relations\r\nwith the other races.\nThe use of magic is heavily emphasized in Altmer society,  given\r\nthe latent magical gifts of the Altmer race. Those Altmer that\r\nrarely or never leave the Summerset Isles are used to a culture in\r\nwhich Magic permeates every level of society. Unfortunately, the\r\nnatural affinity of the Altmer race also leaves them vulnerable\r\nto magical attack; however, most choose to pay little heed to\r\nthis drawback. Aside from their dependence on magic, Altmer\r\nalso tend to place a high cultural value on living for as long as\r\npossible, often using magic to extend their longevity. Altmer\r\nborn and raised on Summerset Isle tend to be haughty and\r\nmore out of touch than those raised in other areas of Tamriel.\nAltmer Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n20\nEnd\n23\nAg\n23\nInt Wp\n30\n28\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n25\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n           Disease Resistance (50%): Characters with this trait have a \n\nchance to resist diseases.

In Jel, their native tongue,\r\nArgonians refer to themselves as Saxhleel (meaning People\r\nof the Root) to show their absolute reverence towards and\r\ndependence on a the Hist, a species of sentient trees that share\r\na singular and extremely intelligent mind. The Argonian people\r\nowe the entirety of their life, culture, and shape to the Hist, as\r\nthe sap of the trees is a necessary catalyst for the metamorphosis\r\nof young Argonians into their humanoid form. Traditionally\r\nminded Argonians also believe the Hist is a repository for their\r\nsouls, reincarnating them after death.\nArgonians are naturally suited to the dangerous environment\r\nof Black Marsh and are resistant to most diseases and poison.\r\nAdditionally, Argonians have the ability to breathe indefinitely\r\nwhile underwater, as well as formidable resistance to many kinds\r\nof damage, courtesy of the Hist. In their homeland, Argonians\r\ntend to live in either desolate, scattered villages or within the\r\nruins of great cities of stone, remnants of the Elves and other\r\nextinct denizens of the Black Marsh. Given the necessity of\r\nthe Hist to their lifestyle, most Argonians rarely leave Black\r\nMarsh by choice; however, some have been known to aban-\r\ndon Argonian society and venture out into the wider world\r\nas adventurers and hired workers. Unfortunately, others are\r\nsometimes forcibly removed from Black Marsh by slavers and\r\nsold as chattel across Tamriel.\nArgonian Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n25\nEnd\n24\nAg\n28\nInt Wp\n27\n24\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n22\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n           Disease Resistance (75%): Characters with this trait have a \n\nchance to resist diseases.

In\r\ntheir own tongue, the Bosmer refer to themselves as the Boiche,\r\nor Tree-Sap People, a reference to their pact with the Aedra\r\nYffre. Like other elves, the Bosmer were originally from the\r\nSummerset Isles; however, the Wood Elves scorned strict and\r\nformal lifestyle of their Aldmeri ancestors, choosing to travel\r\nto mainland Tamriel and live more carefree and simple lives.\r\nChronologically, the First Era is officially marked as starting\r\nwhen the Bosmer united under the rule of the King Eplear, the\r\nfirst of the Camoran Dynasty. Bosmer are known across Tamriel\r\nas competent and deadly bow users; some rumors even claim\r\nthat the Wood Elves were the first to have invented and used\r\nthe bow as a weapon.\nDespite the high status granted to Auri-El by most of the\r\nMerish pantheons, the Bosmer hold Yffre in the highest regard.\r\nAs the first of the Aedra to help stabilize Nirn by becoming\r\nan earthbone, Yffre helped the Wood Elves maintain their\r\nshape during the Dawn Era. The grateful Bosmer accepted\r\nhis patronage, making an oath known as the Green Pact and\r\nvowing to never eat nor harm any vegetation that grew within\r\nValenwood (though other plants outside the province have no\r\nsuch protection). Because of their oath, those Bosmer native\r\nto Valenwood (and even some who leave) are carnivorous, even\r\nengaging in cannibalism on occasion.\nBosmer Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n21\nEnd\n21\nAg\n31\nInt Wp\n25\n23\nPrc\n26\nPrs\n24\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n           Disease Resistance (50%): Characters with this trait have a \n\nchance to resist diseases.

Bretons as a whole are generally dark-\r\nhaired, tall and gifted with a rare amount of intelligence and\r\nwillpower compared to the other races of men across Tamriel.\r\nDespite their height, Bretons tend to have a slighter build, being\r\nless muscular than Redguards or Nords. Bretons are descended\r\nfrom both Aldmeri and Nedic bloodlines, giving them a unique\r\ncombination of abilities that both enhances their innate Aldmeri\r\ntalent for magic and suppresses their vulnerability to magic,\r\nthanks to their Nedic heritage.\nCulturally, Bretons possess a great love of art and philosophy,\r\nas well as an innate connection with magic; this leads many\r\nto scholarly pursuits, becoming great wizards and sorcerers.\r\nBretons are also prone to engaging in knightly pursuits, driven\r\non by a quest-obsession to do good deeds prevalent throught\r\nBreton society.\nAlso worthy of mention are the Reachmen, a splinter group\r\nof Bretons inhabiting the western reach that joins High Rock\r\nand Skyrim. Violently opposed to the Breton kingdoms and\r\ninfighting of High Rock, the Reachmen have formed a tribal\r\nsociety based on hedge magic learned from Orcs and bird-\r\nwitches known as Hagravens. Though far more ferocious than\r\ntheir cultured cousins, the Reachmen live far more primitive\r\nlives, trading the steel blades of High Rock for stone and bone,\r\nthe castles and towers for natural caverns.\nBreton Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n23\nEnd\n21\nAg\n22\nInt Wp\n28\n30\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n25\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n          Resistance (Magic, 2): This character reduces all incoming \n\nmagic damage by 2 and gains a +20 bonus to tests made\r\nto resist non-damaging magical effects.\n           Power Well (10): Characters with this trait have more \n\nmagicka than usual.

Like other elves, the\r\nDunmer were originally from the Summerset Isles; however, they\r\nare descended from the Chimer, a tribe of Aldmeri exiles who\r\nfled Summerset to worship the Daedra, whom they title Our\r\nStronger, Better Ancestors. An agile and graceful people, the\r\nDunmer use their natural magical and physical abilities to their\r\nadvantage in combat. Physically their swordsmanship rivals that\r\nof the Redguards of Hammerfell, while their natural affinity\r\nfor Destruction magic is rivaled only by their distant cousins\r\nin the Summerset Isles.\nDunmer society is divided into two distinct areas: the more\r\ncivilized Great Houses and the nomadic Ashlanders. The Great\r\nHouses of Morrowind behave more like nations than states,\r\ndivided as they are by both culture and politics. The only things\r\nwhich unite the Great Houses are the temple and an almost\r\nuniversal distaste for outlanders.\nBy contrast to the more civilized and political Great Houses,\r\nAshlander society is more tribal-oriented and nomadic. The\r\nAshlanders split from the society of the Great Houses over the\r\nvalidity of the Temples doctrine, a conflict which has divided\r\nthe two sectors of Dunmer society ever since. Those who have\r\nmet the Ashlanders describe them as ferocious, chitin-armored\r\nsavages who are wary of strangers; however, beneath the xeno-\r\nphobic surface of Ashlander society lies a deeply spiritual and\r\ndisciplined lifestyle, a vital key to the survival of the nomads\r\nin the harsh land of Morrowind.\nDunmer Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n25\nEnd\n24\nAg\n29\nInt Wp\n25\n24\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n23\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n          Resistance (Fire, 3): This character reduces all incoming \n\nfire damage by 3 and gains a +30 bonus to tests made to\r\nresist non-damaging fire effects.\nPowers (see the Powers section later in the Chapter)\n           Ancestor Guardian\n\nOther\n       During character creation, Dunmer characters may choose \n\nto begin with the Destruction skill trained to Novice rank\r\nfor free.\n31\n\fImperial\r\nImperials (also known as Cyrods) are a race of men descended\r\nfrom Nedics who settled in the province of Cyrodiil, most nota-\r\nbly Nibenese and Colovians. From the time of the Merethic Era\r\nthe Imperials were held in slavery by the Ayleids (also known as\r\nthe Heartland High Elves) until a Nedic woman by the name\r\nof Alessia organized a successful slave revolt with the help of\r\nher champion Pelinal Whitestrake and demigod Morihaus.\nFollowing the revolt, the Cyrods set up three different empires\r\nunder three different factions: Alessia and her followers, the\r\nReman Dynasty and the Septim Dynasty. Though the empires\r\nhad internal differences, more stark differences arose between the\r\nmore mercantile Nibenese and the rougher Colovians. Where\r\nthe Nibenese Imperials were skilled at trading the creation of\r\nwealth, the Colovian Imperials were influenced by their northern\r\nNordic neighbors, turning to more physical pursuits such as\r\nfarming and war. In fact, such differences kept the Imperials\r\nfrom becoming a unified people until the arrival of Reman\r\nCyrodiil in the First Era and Zero Cuhlecain at the end of the\r\nSecond Era.\nDue to the central position of Cyrodiil in Tamriel, Cyrods have\r\nlearned to become shrewd traders and diplomats.\nThe more Nordic Imperials, Colovians, are rougher and more\r\nphysical than their Nibenese counterparts. The Nibenese are\r\nmore cosmopolitan than their Colovian bretheren and have\r\nexcelled in trade and other such pursuits.\nColovian Characteristic Baseline\nEnd\n27\nAg\n24\nInt Wp\n24\n25\nPrc\n25\nNibenese Characteristic Baseline\nEnd\n23\nAg\n23\nInt Wp\n27\n23\nPrc\n25\nStr\n26\nStr\n24\nPrs\n25\nPrs\n28\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n           (Racial) Star of the West: Imperials increase their Stamina \n\nPoint maximum by 1.\n(Racial) Voice of the Emperor: Imperials speak with a \n\nsmall bit of the power and majesty of the Emperors.

In their native tongue of Taagra,\r\nthe word Khajiit means desert walkers, a fitting epithet for\r\nthe nomadic race. Unlike the other races of Tamriel, there are\r\na variety of different breeds of Khajiit, ranging from bipedal\r\nto quadrupedal, the size of tigers to the size of house cats,\r\nand many in between. Some are even unable to speak, while\r\nothers are hard to distinguish from elves. All of these things and\r\nmore are determined by the moons, cementing their place at\r\nthe center of Khajiit society. Aside from determining a given\r\nKhajiits form and abilities, the moons also form the basis of\r\nthe Khajiits governmental system.\nMost Khajiit value agility and cunning above brute force, as\r\nthese traits are valuable assets for survival in the harsh deserts and\r\ntropical jungles the Khajiit call home. Their natural acrobatic\r\nability, intelligence and unmatched agility make the Khajiit\r\nexcellent guerrilla fighters, adventurers and thieves.\nEach Khajiit breed counts as its own unique race, but only the\r\nSuthay-Raht are presented here. Additional furstocks can be\r\nfound later in this chapter.\nSuthay-Raht\r\nSimilar in height and build to the races of men, the Suthay-raht\r\nare one of the most common breeds of Khajiit. Their coloring\r\nranges from dark brown and orange to light yellow, both with\r\nand without stripes and spots. Suthay-raht are often referred to\r\nas JaKhajiit (meaning kitten) by those of other races; this\r\nappellation often strikes the Khajiit as odd, said title being one\r\nof their names for Mehrunes Dagon.\nSuthay-Raht Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n22\nEnd\n22\nAg\n29\nInt Wp\n25\n21\nPrc\n28\nPrs\n24\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\n           Dark Sight: A character with this trait can see normally \n\neven in areas with total darkness and never takes penalties\r\nfor acting in areas with dim or no lighting.\r\nNatural Weapons (Claws; 1d4; Slashing)\n33\n\fNord\r\nThe Nords are a race of tall, fair haired men hailing from Skyrim\r\nbut found all along the coasts of Tamriel. Originating from the\r\ncontinent of Atmora, the Nords are a fierce and proud people,\r\nknown for their natural aptitude as both warriors and seafar-\r\ners. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, Nords\r\nalso enjoy impressive resistance to magical frost and lightning.\r\nNatural conquerors, the warlike and enterprising spirit of the\r\nNords has greatly influenced the history of Tamriel since their\r\narrival from Atmora in the late Merethic Era, with their armies\r\ndriving the Snow Elves into ruin and providing the strength\r\nand impetus to forge the first empires of man.\nThe Nords consider themselves the sons and daughters of Kyne,\r\nformed when the great Northern Winds broke upon the ground\r\nat the Throat of the World. As such, they consider their breath\r\ntheir very essence and some are able to channel their strength\r\nand power into their voices in magical shouts known as the\r\nThuum.\nHonor and heroism are important virtues to a Nord, for they\r\nbelieve that an honorable life or a valiant death will grant them\r\naccess to Sovngarde, Shors Hall. This belief makes Nords all but\r\nfearless in battle, making war with an energy and enthusiasm\r\nthat terrifies their enemies. This leads many down the path of\r\nthe warrior; consequently, most Nords encountered outside\r\nSkyrim pursue some martial enterprise, be it sellsword, brigand,\r\nor wandering adventurer.\nNord Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n30\nEnd\n28\nAg\n23\nInt Wp\n21\n24\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n23\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\nTough (1): Increase the characters Wound Threshold by 1.\r\nResistance (Frost, 2): This character reduces all incoming\r\nfrost damage by 2 and gains a +20 bonus to tests made to\r\nresist non-damaging frost/cold effects.\r\nResistance (Shock, 1): This character reduces all incoming\r\nshock damage by 1 and gains a +10 bonus to tests made\r\nto resist non-damaging shock effects.\nPowers (see the Powers section later in the Chapter)\n  War Cry\n\nOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds, replace the\r\ntext for the Nords Tough trait with Character gains a\r\n+10 bonus to Shock Tests.\n34\n\fOrsimer\r\nThe Orcs, sometimes known as Orsimer, are barbaric tribes\r\nfound in the north of Tamriel, concentrated in High Rocks\r\nWrothgarian mountain range and with settlements in High\r\nRock, Skyrim, and Hammerfell. Known for their ugly appear-\r\nance (including but not limited to green or red skin, prominent\r\ntusks, and unusual facial bone structure), propensity for violence,\r\nand skill in metalcraft, the Orcs are commonly held to be the\r\nleast of the races. Although officially accepted as citizens by\r\nthe Cyrodiilic Empire after the events of the Warp in the West,\r\nTamriels populace still holds them in low regard, especially in\r\nthe northwest. With the few exceptions of those living in cities\r\nor camps, most Orcs hail from Orsinium or a Stronghold, where\r\nthey are raised from birth to defend their clan and family.\nOrcs have been bred for centuries to survive harsh conditions\r\nand constant assault, and as such have a natural proficiency in\r\nhand-to-hand combat. Their sheer physical strength makes them\r\nformidable opponents when wearing heavy armor and wielding\r\ntwo-handed weapons, especially when using products of their\r\nown design. Most Orcs learn to work metal from a young age,\r\nand even those who do not choose the smithing profession have\r\nbetter skill to maintain their equipment.

They are renowned sword masters and forged an\r\nempire on Yokuda to rival Tamriels own. Following a disaster\r\nwhich destroyed most of their homeland, the emigrated east to\r\nTamriel, where they landed on Hammerfell. In Hammerfell,\r\nRedguard society split into two main camps: Forebears, those\r\nwho had come in the Warrior Wave to purge Hammerfell of\r\ninhabitants, and Crowns, the upper-class who had followed.\nThe Redguards maintain a strong tradition of sword-mastery\r\nand honor to this day, though the significant Redguard piracy\r\npresence suggests interesting definitions of honor. Redguard\r\nwarriors are at their best when using their famed scimitars,\r\ntypically singly with a shield (though there are those who fight\r\nwith two scimitars, known as dervishes). They prefer lighter\r\narmors and cloth to heavy metal, allowing for freedom and\r\nrapidity of movement. Redguards make for strong individual\r\nwarriors, though only rarely does one find a Redguard who is\r\nnot part of a society or band.

However,\r\nits essential to carefully consider them, as most of these may\r\nrequire the GM to pay extra attention to the cultural changes\r\nassociated with these variants.\nBosmer: The Unglamoured\r\nIn the days before the Green Pact, the Bosmer constantly shifted\r\nbetween numerous bestial forms, unable to control or maintain\r\nany single shape. With the assistance of Yffre, they eventually\r\nacquired the ability to adopt a consistent form, evolving into\r\nthe Bosmer known today. Yet, their original wild nature remains,\r\nconcealed but ever-present.\nMost Bosmer show no visible traces of this primal state, their\r\ntrue forms obscured by the wild magic of Glamour. This\r\nGlamour, however, is unpredictable. Some Bosmer lack this\r\nprotective magic, and it remains uncertain whether this absence\r\nis due to divine retribution from Yffre or merely misfortune.\nThese particular Bosmer manifest in various formspart mer,\r\npart beast, satyrs, redcaps, boggles, and other creatures of folk-\r\nloreall marked by entirely black eyes. Within Bosmer society,\r\nthey are regarded with suspicion and caution. Theyre seldom\r\nfound beyond Valenwoods borders, but those who venture\r\nout quickly realize the broader world is as wary of them as\r\ntheir own kin.\nCreating an Unglamoured Bosmer follows the basic profile of\r\nstandard Bosmer characters. However, they gain additional\r\nrules to depict their unique status as shape-shifting outliers:\n(Racial) One With the Wild: Being more in touch with\r\nthe world than their brethren, the Unglamoured have no\r\ntrouble surviving in the wilderness. They receive a +10\r\nbonus on all Survival tests and gain a +20 on all Survival\r\ntests relating to the traits chosen on their Wild Shape racial\r\ntrait.\n(Racial) The Beast Within: The Unglamoured are on the\r\nverge of the Wild Hunt, which can be seen and felt by\r\nothers in their presence.

Both Nords and Bretons\r\nperceive the Reachmen as Mongrels and bloody savages.\nWorshipping what they call the Old Gods, taking part in\r\nblasphemous rituals, utilizing dark magicks and their general\r\nxenophobic nature makes them feared amongst those that\r\noppose them. Their most ill-famed ritual is the rite of the ven-\r\ngeance, in which a Reachman has their heart replaced by a Briar\r\nseed, and infused with a spirit of vengeance to deliver terrible\r\nretribution upon those that stole away their ancestral lands as\r\nan undead avenger.\nThey revere and glorify the Hagravens as their cultural leaders,\r\na practice that most of Tamriel considers to be foul, or simply\r\nplain wrong. For these reasons, the Reachmen are regarded\r\nby most to be a savage people, full of madmen and Daedra\r\nworshippers.\nThe Reachmen persistently and unrelentingly battle the Nords\r\nthat rule over them, raiding their settlements when they can, and\r\npillaging for the sake of causing chaos. Using the land to their\r\nadvantage, and even the very spirits on their side, they battle\r\nto take back the Reach. Driven by revenge for the conquering\r\nof their lands, these men utilize whatever means necessary to\r\ndrive out those that claim the Reach to be theirs.\n37\n\fMaking a Reachman follows the base profile of making any\r\nBreton or Nord character, representing the mixed blood that\r\nmakes up their numbers, but replaces their usual Racial Traits,\r\nPowers, and any benefits listed as Other with the traits below:\nMaking an Ashlander follows the base profile of\r\nmaking a Dunmer character, but gain the following\r\nTraits and bonuses to represent their harsher lifestyle:\n(Racial) Fury of the Old Gods: The witch-men of the\r\nreach are blessed by the Old Gods with a righteous fury\r\ntowards any and all invaders, and will not helm until every\r\nlast one of them are dead at their feet. Any social interaction\r\ntest except Intimidation with people not sympathetic with\r\nthe Reachmen suffers a -10 penalty as their native language\r\nand culture is difficult for outsiders to interpret. However,\r\nthe Reachmen gain a +10 bonus to all Combat Style tests\r\nmade while Frenzied or using the All Out Attack action\r\nas they fight with the fervor of the Old Gods themselves.\r\n(Racial) Accustomed to the Profane: The men and women\r\nof the reach are raised in tribal societies, surrounded by\r\nprofane practices and dark rites, which has tempered their\r\nwills against the petty horrors of the world. They gain a\r\n+30 bonus to resist Panic Tests, and a +20 bonus to resist\r\nHorror Tests.\nOther Benefits\nDuring character creation, a Reachman may choose to\r\nbeing with the Survival skill, or one of the traditional hedge\r\nmagics (Alteration, Destruction, or Mysticism) trained to\r\nNovice rank for free.\nReachmen do not count as their parent race for the purpose\r\nof Elite Advances (example: Tongue advance for Nords), but\r\ncan still take the Racial Talents of their parent race found\r\nlater in this book.\nDunmer: Ashlanders\r\nThe Ashlanders of Morrowind isolate themselves from most\r\nof modern Dunmer society, and have become nomads that\r\ntravel the wastes. They are very distrusting of outsiders, and are\r\ntraditionalist in their way of life.\nAfter the Tribunal rose to power directly following the Battle\r\nof Red Mountain, these Dunmer refused to accept the new\r\nTribunal, believing that they betrayed and killed Lord Nerevar\r\nat the Battle of Red Mountain. They follow the traditional\r\nold ways of ancestor worship as well as worshipping Daedra,\r\nspecifically Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala.\nThe Ashlanders were slowly forced into the most\r\ndangerous and inhospitable parts of Morrowind by the\r\nGreat Houses. This, their nomadic lifestyle, and their\r\nclan based culture caused them to become more hardy\r\nand adaptable in the hot wilderness around the slopes\r\nof Red Mountain.\n(Racial) Life in the Wasteland: Ashlanders are adapted\r\nto life in the volcanic grasslands and deserts around Red\r\nMountain, and as a result gain a +10 bonus on all Survival\r\ntests made in hot climates, and count their Resistance (Fire)\r\ntrait as being one point higher while in these environments.\r\n(Racial) Pride and Prejudice: Any social test except\r\nIntimidation made by or towards an Ashlander suffers\r\na -10 penalty unless the other character is familiar with\r\nAshlander customs and traditions. Additionally, Ashlander\r\ncharacters should keep in mind that most slights are resolved\r\nin their society by ritualized duels, often to first blood,\r\nbut sometimes to the death if the perceived insult is grave\r\nenough to warrant it.\nOther Benefits\nDuring character creation, Ashlanders may choose to\r\nbegin with the Survival skill trained to Novice rank for\r\nfree, instead of Destruction.\nRedguard: Crowns and Forebears\r\nWhile Redguard society as a whole consists of a single race with\r\nno great bodily variation, a cultural divide between the Crowns\r\nand the Forebears split their people down the middle.\nThe people of the Crowns, the old nobility of Yokuda are a more\r\naristocratic people, focusing on trade and positive relations,\r\nwhile the Forebears, also known as the Warrior Wave or RaGada,\r\nwere the common folk of Yokuda who invaded Hammerfell\r\nand made it theirs by the sword. In most games, the difference\r\nwill not matter as most people arent affiliated with the politics\r\nbetween the two factions, but for the games where the difference\r\nmatters, you can choose one of the following profile changes\r\nand apply it to the Redguard base profile.\nCrowns\nThe character gains +1 Personality, and -2 Endurance.\r\nThe character replace Combat Style with Commerce or\nPersuade as their free starting skill.\nForebears\r\nThe character gains +1 Willpower, and -2 Personality.\r\nThe character picks one additional weapon for their Combat\r\nStyle at character creation, but it must be a Sword or variant\r\nof a Sword such as a Sabre or Dagger.\n38\n\fand total HP are halved.\n       The Alfiq cannot speak normally, and must communicate \n\ntelepathically.

When choosing a race from\r\nthis section, always consult your GM first. Depending on\r\nwhen and where your campaign is set, your GM may choose\r\nto prohibit the use of some or all of these races when you\r\nare creating a character. The relevant section for each race will\r\nprovide some advice in this matter to help you and your GM\r\ndecide if a certain type of character is appropriate.\nThe Proto-Races\r\nBetween the Aldmer, Atmorans, Nedes, Chimer, and others,\r\nthere are a variety of races that can be classified as proto-races:\r\nancestors of one or more of the modern peoples of Tamriel.\r\nMuch of what we know about these races tends to come from\r\nmyths and legends maintained by their descendants, and thus\r\ncannot be taken entirely at face value. On the other hand, the\r\nElder Scrolls setting is a strange place, and more often than not\r\nmyths have truth to them. Thus we have decided to leave it to\r\nindividual groups to decide which of these interpretations is\r\nmore appropriate to their campaign. Our general recommen-\r\ndation is to utilize the appropriate modern race as a template\r\nfor their predecessors (Nords for Atmorans, Altmer for Aldmer,\r\netc), making tweaks as appropriate. Groups that favor a more\r\npowerful vision of the ancestral races of Tamriel should feel free\r\nto tack on points and traits as they see fit, while groups looking\r\nfor a more down to earth game should be able to get by just\r\nfine with the races found in the Core Rulebook.\nThe Ayleids\r\nThe Ayleids were the descendants of the Aldmer that emigrated\r\nto Cyrodiil (from Summerset Isle). At one point they controlled\r\nthe entirety of what is now the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil,\r\nand enslaved the indigenous Cyrodilic and Nordic populations.\r\nThese slaves were used in various ways- to build and maintain\r\nroads and temples and to drain fields. Some Ayleids are even\r\nsaid to have tortured slaves for amusement. During the Slave\r\nRebellion of 1E 242 the nearby human kingdom of Skyrim\r\nlent help to their enslaved relatives in the Ayleid Empire, which\r\nplayed a part in the Ayleids being overthrown by the Slave\r\nQueen Alessia and her supporters, and the subsequent shift in\r\npower from Mer to Men on Tamriel.\nIt also appears that Alessias rebellion coincided with a civil\r\nwar within the Ayleid Empire which led to many rebel Ayleid\r\nlords joining forces with Alessia, and aiding her in her rebel-\r\nlion. Though the Ayleids would continue to have a presence\r\nin Cyrodiil for several hundred years more, they were never\r\nagain a major military or political power. This event signaled\nthe beginning of the Late Ayleid Period. Their greatest fortress,\r\nWhite Gold Tower, was turned into the Imperial Palace by\r\nAlessia and her descendants, and it remains so to this day. The\r\nlast of the Ayleids who opposed Alessia held out at a village in\r\nthe vicinity of modern day Bravil and it took Alessias forces,\r\nled by Bravillius Tasus, four attempts to finally defeat them.\nIn 1E 393 the Alessian Order sacked the ancient Ayleid temple\r\nof Malada in their attempts to eradicate all Elven presence in\r\nCyrodiil.\nAyleid culture lingered in the city-states that survived as client\r\nkingdoms of Alessian Cyrodiil, but most of the Elven population\r\nwas finally driven into exile (largely to Valenwood) by the intol-\r\nerance of the Alessian Order, though some Ayleids remained in\r\nCyrodiil, serving as mentors and tutors for the new human\r\nnobility. The last remaining kingdom of the Ayleids, Nenalata,\r\nwas last heard of in 1E 482 at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors;\r\nwhether the Kings people made it through the next few centuries\r\nis unknown, but this was a significant event: the Late Ayleid\r\nPeriod was ended, and the Ayleids would never again be seen\r\nas a military or political power.\nIt is possible that some tribes of Ayleids may continue to live\r\ndeep within the forests of Cyrodiil even today. Yet the most\r\nrecent reported sightings are more than 1000 years old. These\r\nAyleids, or Wild Elves, are at best a rarity and may not have\r\nactually survived into the Third Era. The Ayleid Sage Tjurhane\r\nFyrre talked and wrote extensively of the state of the Ayleid\r\nculture in the late First Era and early Second Era. According to\r\nFyrre, the Ayleids of this time lived in a tribal society, with each\r\ntribe being substantially different from the next.\n42\n\fdotted Tamriel outside Morrowind were mere outposts and\r\nthat there were few significant Dwemer settlements elsewhere\r\nuntil 1E 420.

In reality, they are better described as\r\nhaving been fearsome, unfathomable, and even cruel, though\r\nalso careful, intelligent, and industrious.

There is no known\r\nstory of their dissociation from the Aldmer, which must have\r\noccurred very early in Tamrielic history, as their society bore few\r\ncorrelations with that of the Altmer besides some similar legal\r\nprinciples. The Dwemer built elaborate underground cities near\r\nand beneath mountain ranges, including the Velothi Mountains\r\nand Red Mountain, and in the mountains of the isle Stros\r\nMKai.\nMany misconceptions about them have abounded for cen-\r\nturies: scholars long thought that most Dwemer ruins which\n43\n\fFalmer\r\nThe Falmer (or Snow Elves) were once a proud people with an\r\nunusually great aptitude for magic.

They had a\r\ncivilization which rivaled even the Altmer of the Summerset Isles.\r\nThey had their own language, which was written in a complex\r\nand nearly indecipherable alphabet. They were purported to\r\nuse spears and archery in Combat.\nAfter the Night of Tears in the late Merethic Era, Ysgramor and\r\nhis Five Hundred Companions launched a campaign to drive\r\nthe elves from Skyrim. Ysgramor and his heirs succeeded, and\r\nby the second century of the First Era, during the reign of the\r\nNordic king Harald, the last of the Falmer were driven from\r\nSkyrim to the island of Solstheim. The Falmers civilization\r\nwas obliterated at the Battle of the Moesring with the death of\r\ntheir leader, the Snow Prince. The remaining snow elves were\r\nscattered or slain, and were never heard from again.\nUnknown to the Nords, many Falmer sought sanctuary with\r\nthe Dwemer of Skyrim. The Dwemer agreed to protect the\r\nFalmer, but did not trust them. The Dwemer forced their Falmer\r\nguests to consume a type of toxic fungus found growing deep\nunderground which rendered them blind. The Falmer became\nervants of the Dwemer, and then their slaves. The Dwemer made\r\nthe fungus an essential part of their diet, ensuring that all future\r\ngenerations would be as powerless as their current slaves. The\r\nFalmer were embittered by this betrayal, and rebelled against\r\ntheir dwarven masters. They constructed the Great Statue of\r\nIrkngthand, which contained the Eyes of the Falmer, two\r\nmassive gems embedded in the eye sockets. The Falmer fled deep\r\ninto Blackreach, a gigantic cavern inhabited by the Dwemer.\r\nThus began the War of the Crag, a bloody war between the\r\nFalmer and the Dwemer which took place far below the surface\r\nof Skyrim. Sai, the god of luck, attempted to help the Falmer,\r\nlikely around this time, but they were very hard to find and\r\nunfriendly towards him. Mara later condemned the ice elves, and\r\nconsidered them gone altogether and forever. In 1E 700, when\r\nthe Dwemer disappeared, the Falmer were left to spread freely\r\nthroughout Blackreach. However, centuries of subterranean\r\nslavery, combined with their permanent blindness, had left the\r\nFalmer crippled, and years of fighting the Dwemer had left the\r\nrace bloodthirsty and brutal.\nA small handful of Falmer managed to avoid becoming slaves\r\nto the Dwemer, instead retreating to hidden shrines such as\r\nthe Chantry of Auri-El. These few remaining Snow Elves (as\r\nthey prefer to call themselves) look upon their twisted kindred\r\n(which they refer to as the Betrayed) with pity. However, these\nsentiments were not shared by the Falmer, as they attacked their\r\nuntainted cousins with the same ferocity that they displayed\r\ntowards the other surface races.\nFalmer Player Characters\r\nBelow are the rules for creating Falmer characters. Assuming\r\nyou have the permission of your GM, treat the Falmer just\r\nas you would any other race and follow the usual steps for\r\ncharacter creation.\nFalmer Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n20\nEnd\n23\nAg\n25\nInt Wp\n28\n27\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n26\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\nWeakness (Fire, 2): The Falmer increases all incoming\r\nFire damage by 2 points, and suffers a -20 to resist any\r\nnon-damaging Fire effects.\nResistance (Frost, 3): The Falmer reduces all incoming\r\nFrost damage by 3 points, and gains a +30 to resist any\r\nnon-damaging Frost effects.\nPower Well (10): The Falmer increases their maximum\nMagicka Points by 10.\n(Racial) Chillhearted Fury: Frost damage dealt by the\r\nFalmer using spells or enchantments is increased by 1.\n44\n\fThe Maormer\r\nThe Maormer, also known as Sea Elves or Tropical Elves, are\r\na race of mer that reside on the island of Pyandonea, south of\r\nthe continent of Tamriel. They have blank eyes and colorless,\r\nchameleon-like skin, which is capable of blending in with the\r\nenvironment. It was originally believed that they had lived in the\r\nAltmer home of Summerset Isle and were exiled, but tapestries\r\nfound in the Crystal Tower of Alinor reveal an enmity going\r\nback so far as to make that theory impossible.\nTheir leader is an immortal wizard named Orgnum. The\r\nMaormer practice a snake-like magic which they use to tame\r\nsea-serpents.\nMaormer Player Characters\r\nBelow are the rules for creating Maormer characters. Assuming\r\nyou have the permission of your GM, treat the Maormer just\r\nas you would any other race and follow the usual steps for\r\ncharacter creation.\nMaormer Characteristic Baseline\nStr\n23\nEnd\n20\nAg\n25\nInt Wp\n29\n28\nPrc\n25\nPrs\n22\nTraits (simplified: full rules can be found in Chapter 4)\nWeakness (Shock, 1): The Maormer increases all incoming\r\nShock damage by 1, and suffers a -10 penalty to all tests\r\nmade to resist non-damaging Shock effects.\nPower Well (5): The Maormer increases their maximum\nMagicka Points by 5.\nSwimmer: The Maormers Swim Speed is doubled.\r\n(Racial) Chameleon Skin: The Maormer receives a +10\r\nbonus to any Stealth skills made to blend into their envi-\r\nronment visually.\n(Racial) Sorcerous Serpent Speech: Maormer can speak to,\r\nand understand, the speech of serpents, both land and sea.\r\nHow exactly this functions is left to the GMs discretion.\nOther\r\nDuring character creation, Maormer characters may choose to\r\nbegin with the Athletics skill trained to Novice for free.\nThe Sload\r\nThe Sload are a race of slug-like beastfolk (hence the name, a\r\nportmanteau of slug and toad) living in the Coral Kingdoms\r\nof Thras, southwest of Tamriel.\nSload are innately cautious and careful. In their mythic tra-\r\nditions, all heroes spend years planning, considering and\r\nconsulting with wise Sload before taking the correct action\r\nand achieving their goal. By contrast their villains all act quickly\r\nor rashly and always fail. The Sload language has no word for\r\nadventure, and\r\nthe closest equivalent more accurately means tragic disaster.\nSload apparently do not experience emotions as the Tamrielic\r\nraces do, but are often skilled at acting and may exaggeratedly\r\nsimulate them for the benefit of more emotive beings.\nThey will honor laws, loyalties and friendships only as long as\r\nthey calculate it to be in their best interests to do so. They also\r\nhave no compunctions against blasphemy, theft, kidnapping,\r\nmurder, genocide or anything else that may help them reach\r\ntheir goals. Sload are highly intelligent and have perfect recall of\r\npractically anything they have ever seen or heard. They are quite\r\nskilled at magic, particularly necromancy and teleportation\r\nmagics.\nSload are apparently not religious in any recognizable sense, but\r\nwill willingly serve Daedra if they benefit from it. Some, in par-\r\nticular the famed Second Era necromancer NGasta, also follow\r\nthe King of Worms. It is unknown exactly how Sload reproduce.\r\nThey are believed to be hermaphrodites in their youths, though\r\nthe sexual organs seem to be absorbed by the time they are old\r\nenough to survive on land. Sload parents seemingly have no\r\ninterest in the fate of the young. Upon reaching adulthood the\r\nSload becomes amphibious and has an appearance similar to a\r\nlarge, vaguely humanoid slug.\nWhile young, adults generally lack many of the skills to survive\r\non land. As they age, Sload tend to grow in size and corpulence,\r\nand many older Sload would collapse under their own weight\r\nif not buoyed up by water or by magical means. There is no\r\nknown limit to either the age or the size of an adult Sload.\r\nUnderstandably, this limits their activities on land.\n45\n\fSload Player Characters\r\nBelow are the rules for creating Sload characters.

Additionally, they\r\ngain a +20 bonus to Persuade tests made to intimidate.\nOther\nDuring character creation, the Sload may choose to begin\r\nNecromancy, Mysticism, or Alteration skill trained to\r\nNovice for free, or have all three trained to Novice for\r\n100 XP.\nSload characters are blessed with flawless memory, and never\r\nneed any kind of roll to remember anything they have seen\r\nor heard, and gain +1 bonus DoS on any successful Lore\r\ntests they make.\n46\n\fGenerate CharaCteriStiCS\nDuring this step you will choose your characters favored char-\r\nacteristics and then roll for your characteristic scores, using\r\nthe characteristic baseline appropriate to your choice of race.\nChoose Favored Characteristics\r\nNot all characteristics are created equal! Some characters excel\r\nin certain areas over others, beyond a simple difference in raw\r\ncharacteristic score. Favored Characteristics are those char-\r\nacteristics a character is naturally gifted in; improving those\r\ncharacteristics, or skills and abilities associated with them, is\r\neasier than usual. Each player can choose their characters two\r\nfavored characteristics  (they must be different characteristics).\r\nbefore they generate their characteristic scores. Learning and\r\nranking skills (including specializations) or talents governed\r\nby a favored characteristic, or advancing that characteristic,\r\ncosts 75% of the usual XP cost (round down to the nearest\r\nmultiple of 5).\nRolling Characteristic Scores\r\nOnce you have chosen your two favored characteristics and\r\nhave a characteristic baseline from your race, you can generate\r\ncharacteristics:\n           Roll 2d10 seven times, and assign each roll to one of your \n\nCharacteristics (excluding Luck). Add each roll to the\r\nassigned Characteristic score listed in your Characteristic\r\nbaseline.\n          Roll 2d10, add 30 to the result, and assign the resulting \n\ntwo digit value to your Luck score. Luck cannot exceed\r\n50 and cannot be advanced.\n           If the GM allows it, you may reroll up to three of the sets \n\nof 2d10 from amongst the pool of rolls (but not the one\r\nfor Luck) after all rolls are completed but before you assign\r\nthe results. The new values are final.\nOptional Rule - Point Buy Characteristics\r\nInstead of rolling for characteristics, with GM permission\r\nplayers can instead choose to distribute 80 points amongst\r\ntheir various characteristic scores (not including luck,\r\nwhich is rolled using the standard rule). No more than 20\r\npoints may go to one characteristic.\nFor convenience, all of the characteristics are reprinted here. For\r\nmore information see Defining a Character on page 14.\r\nAdditionally, from this point onward throughout the process\r\na player may choose to permanently reduce their characters\r\nstarting Luck score for certain benefits. These will be explained\nwhen they come up.\nStrength (Str / SB) measures a characters physical prowess\r\nand their ability to employ that prowess and push themselves\r\nto their physical limits.\nEndurance (End / EB) measures a characters physical health,\r\nstamina and toughness, and their resistance to damage.\nAgility (Ag / AB) measures a characters physical speed, reflexes,\r\nand coordination, reflecting their overall ability to move quickly\r\nand gracefully.\nIntelligence (Int / IB) measures a characters mental prowess,\r\nproblem solving, reasoning, ability to recall information, and\r\nunderstanding of the mysteries of magicka.\nWillpower (Wp / WB) measures a characters mental control,\r\nresilience, and their ability to control and shape magicka.\nPerception (Prc / PcB) measures a characters physical aware-\r\nness, as well as the accuracy of their gut instincts and intuition.\nPersonality (Prs / PsB) measures a characters natural charisma,\r\npresence, expressiveness, and social abilities.\nLuck (Lck / LkB) measures a characters good fortune and how\r\noften events tend to go their way. See Luck in Chapter 1.\n47\n\fdeterMine birthSiGn\nNext you roll for your characters Birthsign, choosing the charge\r\nof the Warrior, Mage, or Thief and then rolling a d5 on the\r\nappropriate table. There is a chance during this step that the\r\ncharacter will receive the Star-Cursed version of a sign instead,\r\nreflecting the threatening presence of the Serpent sign at the\r\ntime of their birth. Powers granted by Birthsigns can be found\r\nin the Powers section later in this Chapter.\nLuck\r\nA player may choose to permanently reduce their\r\ncharacters Luck score by 5 in order to choose a Birthsign\r\nof their choice (10 for the star-cursed version) either\r\nbefore or after rolling on the table. Alternatively, if the\r\nplayer decides to roll on the table and rolls a non-star-\r\ncursed sign, they can choose to permanently reduce their\r\ncharacters Luck score by 5 to take the star-cursed version.\nWarrior Birthsign Table\nRoll Result\n1 The Warrior\n2 The Lady\n3 The Steed\n4 The Lord\n5\nReroll, take the Star-Cursed version of the result\nMage Birthsign Table\nRoll Result\n1 The Mage\n2 The Apprentice\n3 The Atronach\n4 The Ritual\n5\nReroll, take the Star-Cursed version of the result\nThief Birthsign Table\nRoll Result\n1 The Thief\n2 The Lover\n3 The Shadow\n4 The Tower\n5\nReroll, take the Star-Cursed version of the result\nOptional Rule - Player Chosen Birthsigns\r\nSome groups may not like the random element intro-\r\nduced by rolling for birthsigns. It is acceptable to simply\r\npick birthsigns without any Luck cost if the whole group\r\nagrees to do so.\nThe Warrior\r\nThe Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation and he protects\r\nhis charges during their Seasons. The Warriors own season is Last\r\nSeed when his Strength is needed for the harvest. His Charges are\r\nthe Lady, the Steed, and the Lord. Those born under the sign of\r\nthe Warrior are skilled with weapons of all kinds, but prone to\r\nshort tempers.\n           Those born under the sign of the Warrior increase their \n\nSP maximum by 1.\n  Star-Cursed Warrior: As above, but also gain 5 Strength \n\nand lose 5 Willpower.\nThe Lady\r\nThe Lady is one of the Warriors Charges and her Season is\r\nHeartfire. Those born under the sign of the Lady are kind and\r\ntolerant.\n           Those born under the sign of the Lady gain 5 Personality.\r\n  Star-Cursed Lady: As above, but also gain 5 Endurance \n\nand lose 5 Strength.\nThe Steed\r\nThe Steed is one of the Warriors Charges, and her Season is Mid\r\nYear. Those born under the sign of the Steed are impatient and\r\nalways hurrying from one place to another.\n           Those born under the sign of the Steed increase Speed by 2.\r\n  Star-Cursed Steed: As above, but also gain 5 Agility and \n\nlose 5 Willpower or Perception (pick one).\nThe Lord\r\nThe Lords Season is First Seed and he oversees all of Tamriel during\r\nthe planting. Those born under the sign of the Lord are stronger\r\nand healthier than those born under other signs.\n           Those born under the sign of the Lord double their natural \n\nhealing rate.\n           Star-Cursed Lord: As above, but also gain 5 Endurance \n\nand the Weakness (fire, 2) trait.\n48\n\fThe Stars of Tamriel are divided into thirteen constellations.\r\nThree of them are the major constellations, known as the\r\nGuardians. These are the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief.\r\nEach of the Guardians protects its three Charges from the\r\nthirteenth constellation, the Serpent.\nThe Firmanent\nThe Mage\r\nThe Mage is a Guardian Constellation whose Season is Rains\r\nHand when magicka was first used by men. His Charges are the\r\nApprentice, the Golem, and the Ritual. Those born under the Mage\r\nhave more magicka and talent for all kinds of spellcasting, but are\r\noften arrogant and absent-minded.\n           Those born under the sign of the Mage gain the Power \n\nWell (10) trait.\n           Star-Cursed Mage: Gain Power Well (25) instead, but lose \n\n5 Perception, Strength, or Personality (pick one).\nanother choice if they wish.\n           Star-Cursed Ritual: Instead gain all the powers perma-\n\nnently, but lose 5 luck.\nThe Thief\r\nThe Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her Season is\r\nthe darkest month of Evening Star. Her Charges are the Lover, the\r\nShadow, and the Tower. Those born under the sign of the Thief are\r\nnot typically thieves, though they take risks more often and only\r\nrarely come to harm. They will run out of luck eventually, however,\r\nand rarely live as long as those born under other signs.\n           Those born under the sign of the Thief roll an extra lucky \n\nnumber that they never lose regardless of their Luck score.\r\nStar-Cursed Thief: As above, but the character replaces\r\ntheir rolled Luck score with 50, gains the Akaviri Danger-\r\nSense power, and the Running Out of Luck trait. Characters\r\ncannot spend Luck to choose this birth-sign. Instead, it is\r\navailable as a choice for any character who naturally rolled\r\nthe Thief sign.\nThe Apprentice\r\nThe Apprentices Season is Suns Height. Those born under the sign\r\nof the apprentice have a special affinity for magick of all kinds, but\r\nare more vulnerable to magick as well.\nThe Lover\r\nThe Lover is one of the Thief s Charges and her season is Suns\r\nDawn. Those born under the sign of the Lover are graceful and\r\npassionate.\n           Those born under the sign of the Apprentice gain the \n\nPower Well (25) trait and the Weakness (magic, 2) trait.\r\nStar-Cursed Apprentice:  Gain Power Well (50) and\n           Those born under the sign of the Lover gain 5 Agility.\r\n           Star-Cursed Lover: As above, but also gain 5 Personality \n\nand lose 5 Willpower or Strength (choose one).\nWeakness (magic, 3) instead.\nThe Atronach\r\nThe Atronach (often called the Golem) is one of the Mages Charges.\r\nIts season is Suns Dusk. Those born under this sign are natural\r\nsorcerers with deep reserves of magicka, but they cannot generate\r\nmagicka of their own.\n           Those born under the sign of the Atronach gain the Power \n\nWell (50) trait, the Spell Absorption (5) trait, and the\r\nStunted Magicka trait.\n           Star-Cursed Atronach: As above, but gain Power Well \n\n(75) instead and lose 5 Agility or Endurance (pick one).\nThe Ritual\r\nThe Ritual is one of the Mages Charges and its Season is Morning\r\nStar. Those born under this sign have a variety of abilities depending\r\non the aspects of the moons and the Divines.\n           Those born under the sign of the Ritual may choose to \n\ngain one of the following powers at the beginning of each\r\nday: Blessed Touch, Blessed Word, Maras Gift. They have\r\nthis power until their next long rest, when they can make\nThe Shadow\r\nThe Shadows Season is Second Seed. The Shadow grants those\r\nborn under her sign the ability to hide in shadows.\n           Those born under the sign of the Shadow gain the \n\nMoonshadow power.\n           Star-Cursed Shadow: As above, but also gain 5 Perception \n\nand lose 5 Personality or Strength (pick one).\nThe Tower\r\nThe Tower is one of the Thief s Charges and its Season is Frostfall.\r\nThose born under the sign of the Tower have a knack for finding\r\ngold and can open locks of all kinds.\n           Those born under the sign of the Tower gain the Treasure \n\nSeeker power and 5 Perception.\n           Star-Cursed Tower: As above, but also gain 5 Agility and \n\nlose 5 Willpower or Strength (pick one).\n49\n\fSpend xp\nAt this point it is time to build the bulk of the character.

All thats left is to calculate your attributes,\r\npurchase gear, generate lucky numbers, and make any other last\r\nminute touches. Then youll be ready to go!\nCalculate Attributes\r\nThe player should now calculate all their attributes based on\r\nthe finalized values of their characteristics. Some of these have\r\nalready been determined. The player should calculate the fol-\r\nlowing attributes and note the values on their character sheet:\n         Health Points (HP): Endurance / 2 (round up)\r\n         Wound Threshold (WT): EB + SB + WB\r\n        Speed: SB + [2 x AB]\r\n        Initiative Rating (IR): AB + IB + PcB\r\n        Carry Rating (CR): [4 x SB] + [2 x EB]\r\n         Magicka Points (MP): Intelligence\r\n        Stamina Points (SP): EB\n\nLuck Points (LP): LB\r\nAction Points (AP): 3\r\nLinguistics: IB - 2, to a maximum of 4 (See Languages\non page 16)\n         Size Category: Standard by default\n\nGenerate Lucky Numbers\r\nBefore finishing off the character, it is time to decide which\r\nnumbers are tied to your fate! Each character has a set of Lucky\r\nand Unlucky numbers that, when rolled as a result of a test, cause\r\na critical success or critical failure (respectively). To generate\r\nyour Lucky and Unlucky numbers, follow these steps:\n          A character has a number of Lucky Numbers equal to \n\ntheir Luck bonus. Roll 1d100 this many times, rerolling\r\nany duplicates. These are your Lucky Numbers!\n         A character has a number of Unlucky Numbers equal to \n\nfive minus their Luck bonus. Roll 1d100 this many times,\r\nrerolling any duplicates (and rerolling any of your Lucky\r\nNumbers). These are your Unlucky Numbers!\nIf a characters Luck bonus changes later, then convert Lucky\r\ninto Unlucky numbers as appropriate.\nPurchase Gear &amp; Equipment\r\nEvery adventurer needs equipment! The budget of drakes that\r\nyour character has available to purchase gear before the start of\r\nthe campaign is left to your GM, but we have provided some\r\nrough recommendations for their use below:\nCampaign Starting Wealth\r\nStarting Drakes\r\nPower Level\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n0-1500\n1500-5000\n5000+\nLegendary\nGM discretion\nThese numbers can vary drastically depending on your cam-\r\npaign. Some legendary games will begin in prisons! It is also\r\nworth noting that you should run your final gear selection by\r\nyour GM for their approval; simply having enough money\r\nto theoretically buy something does not mean your character\r\ncould reasonably acquire it. The specifics will come down to\r\nwhere your campaign is set and the tone and power level your\r\nGM wants to set.\n51\n\fFill Out Your Character Sheet\r\nOnce you have finalized your attributes and purchased your gear,\r\nyou should finish filling out your character sheet, noting any\r\naspects that still need to be finished. Do not forget to fill out\r\nrelevant aspects of the character state, including things gained\r\nfrom equipment, magic, encumbrance level (taking into account\r\neverything the character will be on carrying), and so forth.\nFlesh Out Your Character\r\nDespite how much time we spend on them, the numbers on a\r\ncharacter sheet arent everything. Much of the fun of role-playing\r\nis creating a character who feels like a believable part of their\r\nworld, but it can often be difficult to decide where to start. You\r\ncan spend as much or as little time on this before your game as\r\nyou like, but its always good to put at least some thought into\r\nit. The following are a number of questions to consider when\r\nbuilding any character:\nWhere Are You From?\r\nThis is a critical question, especially in a complex and divided\r\nworld like Nirn. Were you born in your racial homeland? How\r\ndoes your character view their birthplace? How were they treated\r\nthere? Would they rather have been born somewhere else? How\r\ndo other people view them in light of where they are from?\nWhat Is Your Family Like?\r\nAre you an only child, or do you have brothers and sisters?\r\nWhats your place in the family? Are you the eldest and the heir\r\napparent, or the disowned wild child? Are your parents still\r\nalive? If not, how did they die?\nWhat Is Your Social Class?\r\nThose in the upper classes seem to have all the advantages,\r\nbut often the greatest heroes come from the lowest of places.\r\nWhat part of society did your parents come from? Did they\r\npull themselves out of poverty? Are they still there? Or is your\r\nnoble family destitute and on the verge of ruin? How has this\r\ninfluenced your life and your goals? How do you view it?\nWhy Are You Here Now?\r\nWhat did you do before you came to be in the place you are\r\nnow (or with the party if thats the case) and why did you stop?\r\nWhat did you see in an adventuring life?\nHow Religious Are You?\r\nTamriel is a place where gods often walk amongst mortals, but\r\nnot all of them are worthy of worship. How devout are you?\r\nHave you had an important religious experience in your life?\r\nOr do you believe the gods have abandoned you?\nWho Are Your Best Friends and Worst Enemies?\r\nIgnoring the possibility that the other PCs fall into these cat-\r\negories, who in your life would you call a best friend or worst\r\nenemy? What happened to make things that way? Where are\r\nthey now? Do you want to see them again?\nWhat Are Your Prized Possessions?\r\nDo you have any Items of sentimental value? Something passed\r\ndown by your family, a friend, or a mentor? You should also\r\nthink about important things youve already lost that you would\r\ndo anything to get back.\nWho Are You Loyal To?\r\nReal loners are rare: Tamriel can be a dangerous place without\r\nallies. Are there people or organizations that you are loyal to?\r\nWhat did they do to earn your loyalty?\nYes. Youre in Morrowind. I dont know why youre here. Or\r\nwhy you were released from prison and shipped here. But your\r\nauthorization comes directly from Emperor Uriel Septim VII\r\nhimself. And I dont need to know any more than that. When\r\nyou leave this office, you are a free man.\n      Sellus Gravius, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n\nBonds\r\nBonds are short phrases that describe something unique about\r\nyour character personality. They are not necessary something\r\nthat makes you a bad person, but something that can compli-\r\ncate your characters life. Whether its a vendetta, a personality\r\ncompulsion, a large debt, an inconvenient loyalty, or a forbidden\r\nlove, Bonds should be thematic and resonate with your character\r\nto bring depth and more importantly, interesting and organic\r\nplot hooks.\nExample Bonds include:\nIve experienced great loss which I fill by obtaining material\r\ngoods, whatever the cost.\nAt the slightest insult to my honor, I find it difficult to\ntemper my anger.\r\nI have a forbidden lover who I have complicated feelings\r\nregarding.\nA have taken a vow of pacifism and seek to avoid violence\nwhenever I can.\r\nI owe a large debt to an illegal organization.\r\nI am wanted for a crime I didnt commit and seek to return\r\nhonor to my name.\r\nI hold a great grudge against someone who did me wrong\r\nin the past.\r\nI am prideful and would do anything to protect my image.\n52\n\fGaining Bonds\r\nDuring character creation, characters are encouraged\r\nto take a Bond or two. During the course of the game,\r\nthe GM may prompt you to clear existing Bonds if they\r\nare resolved, or add new Bonds that arise throughout\r\nthe course of the campaign.\nExample:\nGM: You see the symbol of the Black Heart Cabal on the\r\ncorpse. It is unmistakable. How do you react?\nErriana: I place my hand on my heart and say Its a\r\nmatter of honour. Ill let no member of the Black Heart\r\nCabal live.\nGM: Okay. Mark down a new Bond: Vendetta against\r\nthe Black Heart Cabal.\nExploiting Bonds\r\nIf your character is in a situation where your Bonds\r\nwill inconvenience, harm, or otherwise make the\r\nsituation worse, someone, including you, can Exploit\r\nyour Bond by describing how its relevant and offering\r\na complication. In that case, you get two options:\nAccept the complication and gain +1 Luck Point\nSpend a Luck to avoid the complication\nExample:\nGM: An old Cyrodiilic man shakes your hand and tells\r\nyou that adventurers are rare these days, and is willing\r\nto help you. The name is Celvus, by the way. Im the\r\nhead of this village, he says in a friendly tone. Roll\r\nObserve for me.\nErriana: I pass.\nGM: While shaking his hand, you notice a tattoo. The\r\nmark of the Black Heart Cabal.\nErriana: I made swore a vow for vengeance. With my left\r\nhand behind my back I draw a dagger and attempt to\r\ngut him.\nGM: You gain a bonus Luck point this session. Roll for\r\nthe attack, +20 for surprise.\nCharaCter traitS\nDuring character creation, players may take certain traits to add\r\nflavor to their characters. A character is not required to take\r\nany traits, but they are recommended. Traits are chosen from a\r\npreset list. Each trait has an associated Trait Point cost or bonus.\r\nCharacter Traits with positive effects (Listed here as Positive\r\nTraits) incur Trait Point costs, while traits with negative effects\r\n(Listed here as Negative Traits) provide Trait Point bonuses.\nIn Character Creation, player characters start with 1 Trait Point.\r\nThen, players may purchase up to 5 Character Traits by pur-\r\nchasing any combination of Negative and Positive Traits. After\r\nCharacter Creation is completed, all remaining Trait Points are\r\nthen lost. However, this is not the end-all be-all for Character\r\nTraits; GMs may determine that, given some series of events or\r\nsome level of character growth, a player character might lose a\r\ntrait and/or gain another.\nPositive Traits\r\nCharacters can spend Trait Points in exchange for gaining one\r\nor more of the following positive traits.\nAttractive\r\n2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is attractive. They gain a +10 bonus to any\r\nPersonality test where their beauty plays a major role in the\r\noutcome.\nBrave\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character is lionhearted and does not scare easily. They gain\r\na +20 bonus on Willpower tests to resist Fear or Intimidation.\nCommon Sense\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character has innately good judgement, allowing them to\r\navoid the simple disasters in life. Any time the character is about\r\nto make an objectively bad decision, the GM should intervene\r\nto prompt the character to reassess things.\nDirection Sense\r\n1 Trait Point\r\nThe character has a good sense of direction, and can always find\r\nnorth when outdoors. Additionally, the character can reroll one\r\nfailed Navigate test per Long Rest.\nFirst Impression\r\n1 Trait Point\r\nThe character makes a good impression and gains a +10 bonus\r\non any Personality test when first meeting someone new.\n53\n\fGood With Animals\r\n2 Trait Points\r\nThe character has an affinity for animals and gains a +10 bonus\r\non any Profession: Animal Handling, Ride, or Survival tests to\r\ntrain or calm an animal.\nPain Tolerant\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character has a high threshold for pain, and gains a +10 to\r\nresist Wounds, and well as only suffering a -10 from the shock\r\neffects of wounds rather than -20.\nPerfect Memory\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character is are blessed with flawless memory, and never need\r\nany kind of roll to remember anything they have seen or heard,\r\nand gain +1 bonus DoS on any successful Lore tests they make.\nPreferred Enemy\r\n1 Trait Point (Character) / 3 Trait Points (Faction)\r\nThe character holds a grudge for a specific character or faction.\r\nThe character gains a +10 on any tests made that bring direct\r\nharm to their preferred enemy, including Cast Magic actions,\r\nmelee and ranged attacks, and other insidious means of harm.\nSituational Awareness\r\n2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is hyper-aware of their surroundings, and can\r\nignore any negative modifiers to Perception for being distracted,\r\nbut not for poor lighting or environmental conditions.\nSlippery\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character is especially flexible and gains a +10 on Acrobatics\r\ntests involving flexibility, and can perform the Resist Secondary\r\nAction using Acrobatics.\nThreat Awareness\r\n3 Trait Points\r\nThe character has a sixth sense for danger. Any time the character\r\nis Surprised, they can choose to roll Initiative instead, but takes a\r\n-20 on all non-defensive reactions in the first Round of combat.\nUnremarkable\r\n2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is exceptionally average looking, which for better\r\nor worse makes them harder to remember and recognize.\r\nWhenever this character attempts to blend in with a crowd\r\n(that being the general public, or dressed similarly to any group\r\nin which hes trying to pass for a member by looks alone) he\r\ngains a +10 to all Subterfuge and Stealth tests made to fit in.\r\nAdditionally when appropriate and at the GMs discretion, any\ncharacter or NPC trying to remember or describe the character\r\nwill either have trouble doing so, such as wrongly describing\r\nthem, or simply being unable to remember them entirely (for\r\nbetter or worse).\nNegative Traits\r\nCharacters can gain the listed Trait Points in exchange for taking\r\non one or more of the following negative traits.\nAddiction (X)\r\n+2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is addicted to some substance, such as alcohol,\r\nmoonsugar, skooma, or even more alien or outlandish drugs\r\nsuch as feldew. Should the character not be able to indulge in\r\nthe drug regularly (more accessible drugs require more frequent\r\naccess), they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests, which increases\r\nin severity by an additional -10 to a maximum of -30 for each\r\npassing day until they get their fix.\nAversion (X, Y)\r\n+1 Trait Point per Y\r\nThe character is afraid of or averse to something (X). This can\r\nbe used to represent a phobia, compulsive avoidance, or strong\r\ndislike of a certain thing. When exposed to their aversion, the\r\ncharacter suffers a -10 per Y on all tests.\nBad Reflexes\r\n+2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is generally slow to react. When rolling for\r\nInitiative, the character rolls twice and takes the lowest.\nCombat Paralysis\r\n+3 Trait Points\r\nThe character has a habit of freezing in dangerous situations,\r\nand must make a Willpower test any time combat breaks out.\r\nIf they fail, they cannot take any actions or reactions during\r\nthe first Round.\nDampened Senses (X)\r\n+1 Trait Point\r\nThe character suffers a -10 penalty on Perception tests based\r\non the selected sense.\nDisturbing Voice\r\n+1 Trait Point\r\nThe character has an intimidating, disturbing voice. They gain\r\na +10 bonus to Persuade tests made to intimidate, but suffers\r\na -10 to all other Personality based tests that involve speaking.\nIlliterate\r\n+3 Trait Points\r\nThe character cannot read or write.\n54\n\fWeak Immune System (X)\r\n+1 Trait Point per X\r\nThe character suffers a -10 * X penalty to Endurance tests made\r\nto resist contracting diseases when exposed. If the character has\r\nthe Disease Resistance trait, first subtract this value from the\r\npercentage on that trait. Any overflow is applied to the penalty.\r\nFor example, if a character has Disease Resistance (25%) and\r\nthey take this trait at a 3 X value, then they suffer a -5 penalty\r\nto their Endurance tests for resisting diseases.\nIncompetent (X, Y)\r\n+1 Trait Point per X\r\nThe character is particularly bad at something. Pick a skill that\r\nthe character possesses, and choose something related to that skill\r\nthe character would be considered incompetent in, just like you\r\nwould choose a specialty. It must be something general enough\r\nthat the character could conceivably be forced to roll at some\r\npoint and must be a skill that the character has trained to at\r\nleast +0, like Swimming for Athletics (the GM is the final arbiter\r\nof what qualifies as such). Whenever the character is forced to\r\nmake a roll with the chosen skill that would be affected by the\r\nchosen Incompetence, gain a -10 penalty to said roll per X.\nLow Pain Tolerance\r\n+3 Trait Points\r\nThe character has a low threshold for pain, suffering a -10 penalty\r\nto resist the Shock Test inflicted by Wounds, as well as against\r\nany Willpower test to resist the effects of pain. Additionally,\r\nthe passive Wound penalty is increased to -30 instead of -20.\nNaive\r\n+2 Trait Points\r\nThe character lacks experience in certain settings. Whenever\r\nthey see fit to do so, the GM can call for the character to make\r\nan Intelligence test in order to not misunderstand a certain\r\nsocial situation.\nOblivious\r\n+2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is often oblivious to danger. The character suffers\r\na -20 on Perception based tests that would determine if the\r\ncharacter is surprised by an enemy or not.\nSocial Stigma (X)\r\n+1 Trait Points\r\nThe character suffers from a stigma (chosen when the trait is\r\ngained) in certain social situations. They suffer a -10 penalty to\r\nsocially related tests in these situations. The character may have\r\nmultiple instances of this trait for different stigmas.\nTimid\r\n+3 Trait Points\r\nThe character is timid and scares easily. They suffer a -10 penalty\r\non Willpower based tests to resist Panic tests or intimidation,\r\nand a -20 penalty on Horror tests.\nUgly\r\n+2 Trait Points\r\nThe character is ugly and suffers a -10 penalty to any Personality\r\nbased tests where their appearance plays a major role in the\r\noutcome.\n55\n\fSevere Negative Traits\r\nThese negative traits follow the same rules as above, but the\r\neffects from picking one of these arent necessarily limited to just\r\nthe gaining of Trait Points, so be sure to read each entry carefully.\nChoosing any of these traits should only be done after careful\r\ndeliberation (from both player and GM), as they can greatly\r\naffect the tone and amount of work required by the GM by\r\nbeing implemented.\nAmnesia\r\n+5 Trait Points\r\nThe character has a gap in their memory, they cannot remem-\r\nber anything that happened during that time period. This is\r\nsomething that should be worked out with the GM, and should\r\ncome back to haunt the character.\nBlind\r\n+4 Trait Points\r\nCharacter has the Blinded condition while they have this trait.\r\nHowever, luck favors the suffering fool, granting them a free\r\nreroll on any one test not related to their lacking sight once\r\nper session.\nDeaf\r\n+4 Trait Points\r\nCharacter has the deafened condition while they have this trait.\r\nHowever, luck favors the suffering fool, granting them a free\r\nreroll on any one test not related to their missing hearing once\r\nper session.\nLingering Injury\r\n+4 Trait Points\r\nThe character has an old injury that comes back to bug them\r\nat the worst times. The GM and the player should work out\r\nthe specifics of the injury, and how it affects the character.\r\nHowever, living with a painful injury has made the character\r\ntough, granting 1 Stamina Point to the character as powering\r\nthrough exhaustion and pain is everyday life for the character.\nStar Cursed\r\n+5 Trait Points\r\nThe character was born beneath an unlucky star and is consid-\r\nered to be ill-fated. Add 2 unlucky numbers to the character.\r\nAdditionally, things simply tend to go horribly wrong in their\r\npresence.\n56\n\fCharacter Names\r\nOne of the hardest parts of making a new character can be\r\ncoming up with the right name. In this section weve provided\r\na list of sample names for the nine major races pulled from a\r\nvariety of the Elder Scrolls games (which is why the number\r\nof names varies somewhat between races and genders).

inherent to certain people that cost\r\nno magicka, but whose use is limited. They are typically granted\r\nby virtue of a characters race or the sign under which they were\r\nborn. Some provide passive effects, while others are activated\r\nabilities.\nAdrenaline Rush\r\nThe character may choose to gain 1 SP at any time. If the\r\ncharacter is fatigued when this power is used then remove a\r\nlevel of fatigue instead. This SP persists only for that encounter,\r\nand this power may only be used once until after the characters\r\nnext long rest.\nAkaviri Danger-Sense\r\nThe character may make a Luck test in order to avoid surprise.\nAncestor Guardian\r\nEach Dunmer is capable of invoking a guardian spirit of one\r\nof their ancestors and can, through the use of the Cast Magic\r\naction, bring that spirit into the Mundus to aid them. The spirit\r\ncounts as a ghost (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement)\r\nwhich, if killed, is sent back to whence it came. Otherwise, the\r\nspirit persists until 30 minutes pass or until the end of a Combat\r\nEncounter that it participates in, whichever comes first. This\r\npower may only be used once until after the characters next\r\nlong rest.\nThe GM should remember for roleplaying purposes that spirits\r\nare capable of communicating with mortals, and that Dunmer\r\nare likely to know the name of their own ancestral spirit. The\r\nGM should also feel free to customize the profile of the spirit\r\nbeyond that of a generic ghost.\nBlessed Touch\r\nThis character can speak the word of the divines for an hour\r\nin order to remove a single wound and all of its effects (not\r\nincluding lost limbs) from another character. This also restores\r\nan amount of HP equal to the amount of damage dealt to cause\r\nthe wound. This character or the target character may choose\r\nto burn 2d6 Luck to allow this power to also restore lost limbs.\r\nThe target character must remain still for the entire duration\r\nwhile the character performs the ritual. This power can only be\r\nused once until after the characters next long rest.\nflee the circle and no characters with those traits may willingly\r\nenter it unless they can pass a -40 Willpower test (which may\r\nonly be attempted once per round).\r\nThe circle follows the character, but it only remains as long\r\nas they continue to speak the words and take the Cast Magic\r\naction each turn. Blessed Word can be sustained for at most 1\r\nminute (10 rounds). This power can only be used once until\r\nafter the characters next long rest.\nThe Calling\r\nThe Dwemer have developed the capability to form connections\r\nwith the minds of others, allowing silent and instant com-\r\nmunication across great distances. A Dwemer may do this at\r\nany time, though they may not attempt to contact someone\r\nthey have not met. Forming a mental connection requires the\r\ncharacter to pass a Willpower test or gain a level of fatigue. Once\r\na connection is formed the two minds may communicate as\r\nthey see fit. Every minute of communication beyond the first\r\nimposes another Willpower test, where failure incurs a level\r\nof fatigue. Alternatively, they may form a connection with a\r\nnumber of others equal to their Willpower bonus, but doing so\r\ncauses them to automatically fail the Willpower tests imposed\r\nby normal communication.\nMaras Gift\r\nThis character can speak the word of the divines for an hour\r\nin order to remove a single wound and all of its effects (not\r\nincluding lost limbs) from themselves. This also restores an\r\namount of HP equal to the amount of damage dealt to cause\r\nthe wound. The character may choose to burn 2d6 Luck in\r\norder to allow this power to also restore lost limbs. The character\r\nmust remain still for the entire duration while they perform\r\nthe ritual. This power can only be used once until after the\r\ncharacters next long rest.\nMoonshadow\r\nThe character possesses a simple form of innate shadow magic.\r\nThis power may be activated once a day with the use of the Cast\r\nMagic action. The character becomes Invisible for 18 seconds\r\n(3 rounds). The character may spend a Luck point, or burn\r\none Luck, to extend this duration by one round (this may be\r\ndone as many times as the character desires). This invisibility is\r\nbroken if the character makes an attack, after which it reforms\r\nat the beginning of the next round as long as there is 1 round\r\nof duration left. This power may only be used once until after\r\nthe characters next long rest.\nBlessed Word\r\nThe character may begin speaking the word of the divines\r\nthrough the use of the Cast Magic action. This has the effect\r\nof creating a circle with a radius equal to their Willpower bonus\r\nin meters. Characters with the Undead or Undying traits must\nTreasure Seeker\r\nThe character has a knack for finding treasure and overcoming\r\nthe obstacles that protect it. At any time the character can choose\r\nto reroll a failed Subterfuge test made to pick a lock or disarm\r\na trap, but only once for a given test. This power may only be\n60\n\fused once until after the characters next long rest.\nWar Cry\r\nNords are able to call on a very simple form of the Thuum and\r\nharness it to frighten their enemies in battle. As an action, they\r\ncan issue a mighty war cry that forces all enemies who hear it\r\nto make a Panic (+30) test. If a character passes this test, they\r\nare immune to the effects of this power for the remainder of\r\nthe encounter. This power may only be used once until after\r\nthe characters next long rest.\n61"},"Chapter_3_Skills/Chapter_3_Skills":{"slug":"Chapter_3_Skills/Chapter_3_Skills","filePath":"Chapter_3_Skills/Chapter_3_Skills.md","title":"Chapter_3_Skills","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 3: Skills\nTo achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is youre doing. It aint simply enough to perform a\nperfect thrust of a blade — you must also know what you are doing and why.\nSeryne Relas, Breathing Water\n\fMost tasks that a character can perform are measured by\ntheir skills. Skill ranks reflect the characters experience,\r\ntraining, and overall ability to perform these actions. Skills\r\nare either trained or untrained. Each trained skill has a corre-\r\nsponding Skill Rank, which has an associated value from 0\r\nto 5. This reflects how capable the character is at utilizing that\r\nskill. Each skill has one or more Governing Characteristics: a\r\nset of characteristics that reflect the many ways that a character\r\ncan utilize a single skill.\nSkill Ranks\nSkill Rank (Value)\r\n(Bonus)\nTotal XP\r\nRequired\nXP (total) Equivalence\n(Untrained) (-20)\nNovice (0) (+0)\n\n\n\n\n\n100\nApprentice (1) (+10)\n1000\n200 (300)\nNo knowledge.\nRudimentary\r\nknowledge.\nBasic\r\nproficiency.\nJourneyman (2) (+20)\n2500\n300 (600) Competent.\nWhen a character makes a skill test, they apply a bonus equal\r\nto +10 times the value of their skill rank (starting at +0 for\r\nnovice [rank 0], and up to +50 at master [rank 5]) to the chosen\r\ncharacteristic. Typically the player chooses which characteristic\r\nto use, but the GM may require that they must use a particular\r\none if they feel the circumstances dictate such. If a character\r\nuses an untrained skill, the test suffers a -20 penalty.\nSpecializations\r\nTrained skills can also have accompanying Specializations,\r\nwhich represent areas of concentration and focus in a characters\r\ntraining and experience with that skill. A character may take as\r\nmany specializations as their rank in a given skill for 100 Xp\r\neach. When making a skill test in the listed area of specializa-\r\ntion, the character gains an additional +10 bonus to the test. A\r\ncharacter may not benefit from more than one specialization\r\nat once. Example specializations are provided for each skill, but\r\nplayers should feel free to create their own with GM permission.\nSkill Types\r\nThere are two types of skills, Standard Skills and Field Skills.\r\nStandard skills function as described above, but field skills are\r\ndifferent and can be identified by the [Field] in their name.\nField skills are collections of related skills that all function inde-\r\npendently as standard skills. For example: Profession [Smithing]\r\nand Profession [Medicine] function as separate skills that must\r\nbe trained and ranked up independently. Both skills have their\r\nown separate skill rank, though they function similarly because\r\nthey share the same parent skill. Sometimes the fields will share\r\ngoverning characteristics, but sometimes each will have its own.\nLearning and Advancing Skills\r\nThe XP cost to learn a skill (upgrade it to trained, novice rank)\r\nis 100 XP. From then on, the cost to advance to the desired\r\nrank varies. Skill ranks are advanced in order.\nFavored Skills\r\nA characters favored skills are those skills that are governed by\r\nat least one of the characters Favored Characteristics.

Combat Styles can\r\nbe associated with culture, careers, or even schools of combat.\nSpecifically, individual Combat Styles are represented by the\r\nCombat Style [Field] skill, where the field is the name of the\r\ncombat style. This skill is used to make melee (or ranged) attack\r\nand defense tests in combat when using the equipment associ-\r\nated with the style. The character may use either their Strength\r\nor Agility as a base for the skill test when making melee attacks\r\nand most defense tests but must use their Agility when making\r\nranged attacks.\nRather than creating preset combat styles we have allowed play-\r\ners and GMs to invent their own to more accurately reflect the\r\ncharacters they wish to portray. Each combat style should be\r\naccompanied by a list of equipment it incorporates (see below),\r\nand a description of the style of fighting that it represents (see\r\nexamples to the bottom right).\nTrained Equipment\r\nEach Combat Style has an associated set of weapon, armor, and\r\nshield types. A character with that Combat Style is capable of\r\nusing that equipment effectively in the situations the style is\r\ndesigned for. Combat Styles may include up to five different\r\ntypes of equipment when the skill is purchased for the first\r\ntime. Unarmed combat is included in this category as well,\r\nreflecting that the character is trained to fight without weapons.\r\nArmor is divided into types using the associated weight class\r\nquality: light, medium, heavy, or super heavy. Armor without\r\na quality requires no training.\nEach styles associated trained equipment is chosen when the\r\ncharacter learns the style, and it can be expanded to a maximum\r\nof ten different types of equipment. Expanding a combat style\r\nby adding a weapon, armor, or shield type to the list of a\r\nstyles trained equipment costs 25 XP.\nSpecial Advantages\r\nIn addition to equipment, each Combat Style also has an associ-\r\nated set of Special Advantages. This list is a set of Special Actions\r\n(page 100) that the character is able to use as an advantage\r\ninstead of the listed action type. A Combat Style starts with a\r\nsingle chosen Special Action in this list of Special Advantages.\r\nExpanding this list of Special Advantages costs 25 XP per\r\nSpecial Action. There is no limit to the number of Special\r\nAdvantages that can be included in a Combat Style.\nWhen the character uses this special action as an advantgage,\r\nthey ignore the AP cost, or automatically win any opposed\r\nroll involved.\nFighting in Unfamiliar Circumstances\r\nOccasionally characters may be forced to fight with familiar\r\nweapons, but in strange circumstances. For example, a noble\r\nwho is used to fighting honorable one-on-one duels might be\r\nforced into a chaotic bar-brawl. Or perhaps a battlefield soldier\r\nused to fighting on horseback finds themself face to face with\r\nan assassin at home.\nGenerally most characters are trained to use the weapons in\r\ntheir style in widely applicable circumstances, but in certain\r\ncases like these the GM shouldnt be afraid to impose a -10\r\npenalty (or more, if appropriate) on Combat Style tests made\r\nby a character who is out of their element.\nThe Princes longblade slashed across the Akavirs chest and\r\nthe sudden, intense pain cuased him to drop his weapons. In\r\na moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostrate in the\r\ndust with the Princes longsword at this throat. The games\r\nover! shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause\r\nfrom the stadium.\n2920, The Last Year of the First Era\nUtilizing Untrained Weapons/Armor\r\nCharacters who use weapons, armor, or other equipment that\r\nthey are not trained to use suffer the usual -20 penalty for using\r\nan untrained skill on any associated combat tests, movement\r\ntests in the case of armor, or any other tests that the GM deems\r\nappropriate. The GM may choose to alter or ignore this penalty\r\nif they feel the circumstances do not apply.\n69\n\fCombat Style Examples\r\nBelow are some example Combat Styles to use for inspiration\r\nin your campaigns.\nCombat Style [Cloak and Dagger]\r\nThe character is trained to use small, concealable weapons in close\r\nquarters against single, typically unarmored, opponents.\n      Equipment:  Dagger, Shortsword, Throwing Dagger, \n\nUnarmed Combat, Light Armor.\nSpecial Advantages: Feint\nCombat Style [Imperial Legionnaire]\r\nLegionnaires are trained to fight in battlefield formations with sword,\r\nspear, and shield, using javelins to soften up the enemy.\n      Equipment: Spear, Shortsword, Javelin, Tower Shield, \n\nMedium Armor.\r\nSpecial Advantages:\nCombat Style [Knight]\r\nKnights are masters of chivalrous combat, preferring to engage their\r\nopponents in duels of honor and skill. In open battle they wear\r\nheavy armor and fight primarily from horseback.\n      Equipment: Lance, Shield, Longsword, Mace, Heavy \n\nArmor.\nCombat Style [Argonian Guerrilla Fighter]\r\nThe Black Marsh is known across Tamriel for its guerrilla fighters.\r\nArgonian warriors fight in light armor with short blades, spears,\r\nand at range, engaging their enemies in small skirmishes.\n      Equipment: Shortsword, Spear, Short Bow, Javelin, \n\nUnarmed Combat.\n70"},"Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics/Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics":{"slug":"Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics/Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics","filePath":"Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics/Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics.md","title":"Chapter_5_Advanced_Mechanics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 5: Advanced Mechanics\nWe dont have shields in our culture. It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you dont\nwant to get hit, you move out of the way.\nAkaviri Potentate Versidue-Shaie, 2920, The Last Year of the First Era\n\fIn most adventures there is conflict, and this conflict is often\nphysical. After all, the world of the Elder Scrolls can be a\r\ndangerous place. Wars, strange monsters, criminals, mercenaries,\r\nfaction infighting, and any number of other scenarios can all\r\nforce a party to use violence to accomplish their goals, or simply\r\nforce the party into dangerous situations. This chapter contains\r\nmechanics for resolving combat, as well as other game mechanics\r\nto handle the variety of situations the players might encounter\r\nduring their adventures.\nA Note on Time\r\nThe UESRPG divides time into two categories: narrative time\r\nand structured time. Narrative Time is meant to be used in\r\nany situations that do not demand the time-sensitive resolution\r\nof tasks. Functionally this means that almost any non-combat\r\nsituation will use narrative time. In game terms, narrative time\r\nis a period in which the GM can freely advance time at any rate\r\nbased on the needs of the story and the players. This could mean\r\nbriefly describing the partys long journey across a vast desert,\r\nor playing out an important conversation minute by minute.\nStructured Time is used to handle time-sensitive events in\r\nwhich every second counts and the exact order of actions is\r\ncrucial. Combat almost always takes place in structured time,\r\nwhich is what the rules of this chapter are intended for; though\r\nthe GM could decide to handle it in narrative time instead.\r\nCoMbat\nThe largest unit of structured time is called an encounter. An\r\nEncounter represents an entire sequence of dramatic events\r\nthat make up a unified block of structured time that may be\r\ncontained within sections of narrative time, or followed up by\r\nanother encounter. Encounters focused on a particular combat\r\nscene are known as Combat Encounters.\nEncounters are broken down into Rounds: periods of time in\r\nwhich characters take actions, representing roughly six seconds\r\nof real time. During a round the GM counts down from\r\nhighest to lowest initiative, giving each character a turn to act\r\nwhen their initiative step is reached, until every character has\r\nhad a turn. During a Turn, the active character spends at least\r\n1 AP to perform an action and resolves its effects. Sometimes\r\nthe rules will refer to initiative steps, which simply refer to\r\nindividual initiative values in the order.\nEffect Durations\r\nEffect durations are measured in rounds and end immediately\r\nafter the initiative step on which they took effect. For example,\r\nif an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their turn, they remains-\r\nstunned until right after the end of their turn 2 rounds later\r\n(assuming their turn takes place at the same initiative step as\nit did originally).\nCombat Overview\r\nCombat encounters can be resolved by following these steps:\nStep 1: Determine Surprise\r\nIf one or more characters arent expecting an attack, or aware of\r\ntheir attackers intentions, they have been surprised. The GM\r\nshould determine which characters count as being surprised for\r\nthe first round of combat. Surprised characters do not roll 1d6\r\nfor initiative; they simply use their Initiative Rating. They also\r\nmay only take reactions until after their first turn has passed.\nStep 2: Set the Scene\r\nBefore the characters can begin taking their turns, the GM\r\nshould outline the parts of the scenario that they are aware of,\r\nincluding the combatants they face, the positions of everyone\r\ninvolved, and the environment theyre fighting in. If the group\r\nis using a battle map or grid, this would be the time to set it up!\nStep 3: Determine Initiative\r\nTo determine the order in which characters take their turns\r\nduring each round of the combat, all characters involved must\r\nmake an Initiative Roll. An Initiative Roll is made by roll-\r\ning 1d6 and adding the characters Initiative Rating. Use the\r\ncharacters Initiative Rating and then Luck bonus (meaning\r\nPCs beat NPCs) to break ties, in that order. Further ties can\r\nbe resolved by contested Luck Rolls or at the GMs discretion.\r\nThe GM rolls initiative for any NPCs involved and should roll\r\nonce for larger groups of similar NPCs. If new combatants\r\nenter the picture, simply have them roll and take their place in\r\nthe order as appropriate.\nStep 4: Round Start\r\nStarting with the character with the highest initiative, each\r\ncharacter takes one turn. At the start of the round, all char-\r\nacters replenish their AP. Then, during each Turn, the active\r\ncharacter spends AP to perform combat actions and resolves\r\ntheir effects. Once their turn is over, the character with the\r\nnext highest initiative takes their turn. This repeats until all\r\ncharacters have taken a turn.\nOptional Rule: Turn-Based AP Refreshing\r\nFor an alternative strategic experience, your group\r\ncan choose to play with this variant AP Refreshing\r\nruleset. As combat starts, all characters start the\r\nfirst round with their Maximum AP. Then, in all\r\nsubsequent rounds, characters replenish their AP at\r\nthe start of their turn rather than at the start of the\r\nround.\n96\n\fStep 5: Round End\r\nOnce all characters have had a turn, the round is over, regardless\r\nof the amount of AP any characters have remaining. Any effects\r\nor Conditions that specify a duration of until the end of the\r\nround end now.\nStep 6: Encounter Ends\r\nRepeat steps 4 and 5 until the combat is finished or the event\r\nthat triggered the switch into structured time is resolved.\nMapping Combat\r\nThis chapter assumes players are using some sort of grid or battle\r\nmap to track the positions of characters. For ease of use, each\r\ngrid square in such a system should represent a square meter.\nMore details on using a combat grid, or advice for playing the\r\ngame without one, can be found later in this chapter.\nAction Types\r\nActions represent all the things that a character can do during\r\nan encounter. The maximum number of times that a character\r\ncan act during a round is determined by their max AP. All\r\nnon-free actions cost at least 1 AP unless otherwise stated.\nPrimary Actions can only be taken during the characters own\r\nturn. They are dedicated combat actions where the character\r\nis the instigator, and a character may take any number. An\r\nextended action is an action that requires the use of more\r\nthan one AP, which can cause it to require more than one turn.\nSecondary Actions can only be taken during the characters\r\nown turn or as reactions. They are combat actions that require\r\nless dedication from the character and can be taken somewhat\r\nreactively to battlefield circumstances. A character may take\r\nany number of these.\nReactions are actions that are taken to counter or resist other\r\ncharacters actions or other events that the character is aware of.\r\nOnly one reaction attempt is permitted for each threat or event,\r\nbut any number of reactions may be made per round (provided\r\nthat the character has action points left for that round to spend).\nSpecial Actions are a unique class of actions that are often\r\ntaken in opposition to another character and can be taken when\r\na character has gained Advantage in combat. Special actions\r\ncan be either primary/secondary actions or reactions, and they\r\nfollow all the normal rules for an action of their type.\nFree Actions can be taken at any time during the combat\r\nround and cost no action points to activate; though the GM\r\nshould keep in mind what is reasonable for a character to achieve\r\nin six seconds.\nMultiple Action Turns\r\nBecause characters can take multiple primary or secondary\r\nactions on their turn, it is possible that characters can use up\r\nall of their AP to create some interesting action combinations\r\nwhen their turn arises. When declaring multiple actions on\r\ntheir turn, the character must declare them individually,\r\nresolving other characters reactions first before declaring\r\nand resolving any more.\nMovement Budget\r\nA characters Movement Budget is determined by their highest\r\nspeed (usually base speed). During their turn a character can\r\nmove a total number of meters up to their Movement Budget.\nThis movement can take place at any point during a characters\r\nturn, either before or after any actions they take.\nExample: a characters Base Speed is 13m and their Climb Speed is\r\n7m, so their Movement Budget is 13m. They make a standard move\r\nfor 8m, so they can only climb for 5 meters with their remaining\r\nMaximum Movement unless they use a Dash action.\nMore details on movement can be found in the Movement &amp;\r\nSize section.\nPrimary Actions\r\nThe following primary actions are all actions that can only be\r\ntaken during a characters own turn. Unless otherwise noted,\r\nthey cost 1 AP.\nAttack\r\nThe character can make an attack with a melee or ranged weapon.\r\nA character may make no more than two total attacks in\r\na single round. When attacking they can use one of three\r\noptional variations of this action. A player must declare if their\r\ncharacter is choosing one of these variations before the attack\r\ntest has been made.\n                   All Out Attack (melee only): The character makes a melee \n\nattack with a +20 bonus by spending an additional AP. This\r\nis not an extended action.\r\nCoup de Grce: The character makes a killing blow against\r\na helpless target. A helpless target is one who is either\r\nunconscious, both restrained and prone, or otherwise phys-\r\nically incapable of defending themselves. The GM may rule\r\nthat certain characters cannot be killed in this way depend-\r\ning on the circumstances. This kills the target outright.\r\nFor unarmed Coup de Grce, refer to the Grappling rules.\r\nPrecision Strike: A character attempting a precision strike\r\nis aiming to hit a particular part of their opponents body\r\nand thus suffers a -20 penalty on the attack test. If successful,\r\nthe character may choose the hit location of that attack in\r\naddition to resolving any other effects the attack would have.\n97\n\fDisengage\r\nThe character can use this action to retreat from combat with\r\nan enemy. If they move out of an enemys engagement range\r\nduring this turn then the attack of opportunity reaction or\r\nother delayed actions/reactions, may not be taken against them.\nCast Magic\r\nThe character casts a spell that they know using the rules for\r\nspellcasting found in Chapter 6. This may be used to cast\r\nspells that count as attacks, but a character may make no\r\nmore than two attacks in a single round.\nDelay Turn\r\nThe character declares a set of circumstances in which they\r\nwill act. The character then skips their turn without spending\r\nAP and may insert their delayed turn into the order as a free\r\nreaction if the conditions are met. If the delayed turn is not\r\ntaken before the characters next turn would occur, then the\r\naction points are lost entirely.\nDefensive Stance\r\nUsing this action grants the character +10 on any defensive\r\ntests made until their next turn. Taking this action reduces the\r\ncharacters Attack limit to 0 until their next turn.\nSecondary Actions\r\nThe following Secondary Actions are actions that can be taken\r\nduring a characters own turn or as reactions for 1 AP.\nAim\r\nA character can spend an action aiming in order to gain a\r\n+10 bonus to their next ranged attack, including spells with\r\nthe Bolt form. This bonus can stack if the character takes this\r\naction multiple consecutive times before the next ranged or\r\nbolt attack, but only up to three times for a maximum bonus\r\nof +30. The chain of aim actions can stretch across rounds.\r\nThis chain is broken and the bonus lost if the character makes\r\nan attack with another weapon or takes any actions or reactions\r\nother than to continue aiming or fire the aimed weapon or spell.\r\nOnce the aimed weapon is fired, the bonuses from this action\r\nare reset to +0.f\nCast Magic (Instant only)\r\nThe character casts a spell that they know using the rules for\r\nspellcasting found in Chapter 6. This may only be used to cast\r\nspells that have the Instant Spell Attribute.\nDash\r\nThe character can use this action in order to move up to their\r\nspeed. If this is done on their turn, this movement is added\r\nto their base movement for that turn. This action can be used\nto allow a character to move several times their speed during\r\na round.\nHide\r\nThe character can use this action to attempt to hide from foes.\r\nIf anyone might detect them while they do this, they must\r\nmake a Stealth skill test opposed by the Observe of anyone who\r\nmight spot them. On success, they gain the Hidden condition.\nReady Weapon / Drink Potion\r\nThe character may draw, sheath, withdraw, or reload a weapon.\r\nThis action may also be used to drink a potion, assuming it is\r\naccessible to the character, but this costs 2 AP instead. Some\r\nmissile weapons may require several AP to reload, in which case\r\nthis action must be extended.\nReactions\r\nReactions can be used at any time during the combat round in\r\nresponse to a threat or event that a character is aware of by\r\nspending an AP. Reactions can be triggered by other reactions:\r\nif this happens, resolve them however makes the most sense.\nAttack of Opportunity\r\nThis reaction allows a character to take advantage of an opening\r\nto make a melee attack (max 2 attacks per round) against an\r\nopponent when they are vulnerable. Attacks of Opportunity\r\nare resolved before the action they are being made in reaction\r\nto is resolved. Any character may use a reaction to an Attack\r\nof Opportunity without interrupting their current action, but\r\nthey must be able to see their target. An Attack of Opportunity\r\nmay be triggered by the following:\n                Retreat: When an opponent voluntarily moves out of the \n\ncharacters melee range without taking the disengage action.\r\nApproach: When an opponent moves closer to the char-\r\nacter within their melee range (such as from 3 meters away\r\nto 2 meters away against a 3m range weapon).\r\nSpellcast: When an opponent casts a spell within their\r\nmelee range (unless the spell counts as a melee attack).\r\nStanding Up: When a prone character stands up within\r\ntheir melee range without using the Arise action.\r\nRanged Attack: When an opponent makes a ranged attack\r\nwithin the characters engagement range.\r\nReady: When an opponent readies a weapon, reloads a\r\nweapon, or drinks a potion within their melee range. If\r\nthe opponent does so as a free action, it does not allow for\r\nan attack of opportunity.\nBlock, Parry, Evade\r\nThe character tries to defend against an incoming ranged or\r\nmelee attack. See the Attacking &amp; Defending section for details.\n98\n\fCounter-Attack\r\nThe character attempts to make a standard melee Counter-Attack\r\n(still subject to the two attack per round limit) in response to\r\nan attack from an opponent they are aware of through the use\r\nof their Combat Style skill. See Attacking &amp; Defending.\nFree Actions\r\nFree actions can be performed at any time during the combat\r\nround and cost no action points. They include things like talking,\r\nsignaling, observing ones surroundings, dropping items, and so\r\nforth. Use common sense when deciding what is a free action.\n99\n\foppose with their Combat Style or Athletics skill. If they win,\r\nthey may move themself and their opponent up to three meters\r\nin any direction (they must both move in the same direction\r\nand the same amount) as the character shifts the location of the\r\nfight. Target character must be within melee range.\nResist\r\nSecondary Action\r\nCharacter makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test\r\nwhich their opponent may oppose with their Athletics or\r\nunarmed Combat Style skill. If they win, they may escape being\r\nrestrained, grappled, or blinded.\nTrip\r\nSecondary Action\r\nCharacter makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test\r\nwhich their opponent may oppose with their Athletics, unarmed\r\nCombat Style, or Evade skill. If they win, their opponent falls\r\nprone. Target character cannot be of larger size and must be\r\nwithin 2 meters.\nThe best techniques are passed on by the survivors.\nGaiden Shinji\nSpecial Actions\r\nSpecial actions reflect unique ways that characters can engage\r\nin combat, and can be taken as actions of their listed type\r\nduring a combat roll. Alternatively, if a character has one of\r\nthese special actions in their list of Special Advantages (page\r\n69), it can be used as an advantage instead.\nArise\r\nSecondary Action\r\nAllows the character to use a momentary opening to roll back\r\nup to their feet, removing the prone condition without granting\r\nopponents the ability to make an attack of opportunity.\nBash\r\nPrimary Action\r\nCharacter makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test\r\nwhich their opponent may oppose with their Athletics, unarmed\r\nCombat Style, or Evade skill. If they win, their opponent is\r\nknocked back 1 meter, loses an AP, and must make an Acrobatics\r\ntest to avoid falling prone. Target character cannot be of larger\r\nsize and must be within 2 meters.\nBlind Opponent\r\nSecondary Action\r\nCharacter makes a Combat Style test which their opponent\r\nmay oppose with their Evade or Combat Style (if wielding a\r\nshield). If the target loses, they become blinded for 1 round.\r\nThe character must reasonably have access to some way to blind\r\ntheir opponent (thrown sand or rocks, for example).\nDisarm\r\nPrimary Action\r\nCharacter makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test\r\nwhich their opponent may oppose with their unarmed Combat\r\nStyle or Athletics skill. If the target of the disarm attempt loses,\nthe character may choose to either take the targets weapon if\r\nthey have a free hand or fling the targets weapon 1d4 meters\r\nin a random direction. Target cannot be of larger size and must\r\nbe within 2 meters. Cannot disarm natural weapons.\nFeint\r\nPrimary Action\r\nCharacter attempts a Combat Style or Deceive test against an\r\nopponents Observe or Combat Style within a 2m range. If\r\nsuccessful, they treat their next melee attack against the target\r\nas if they were Hidden. This effect only applies if the attack\r\noccurs before the end of the characters current turn.\nForce Movement\r\nPrimary Action\r\nCharacter makes a Combat Style test which their opponent may\n100\n\fAttacking &amp; Defending\r\nCombat is resolved as an exchange of blows between two charac-\r\nters. This exchange is simulated by the Combat Roll, in which\r\na pair of attack and defense tests are compared.\nStep 1: Attack\r\nThe attacker first chooses their target, weapon, and combat style\r\nfor the attack before making the attack test and applying any\r\nrelevant circumstantial modifiers. Weapons not included in the\r\ncharacters combat style are made at the standard untrained\r\n-20 penalty for all attack and defense tests.\n                 Melee Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat \n\nStyle test using either Strength or Agility against a target\r\nwithin the range of their weapon.\r\nRanged Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat\r\nStyle test using Agility against a target within the range of\r\ntheir weapon.\r\nCast Magic Attacks: The attacking caster makes a skill\r\ntest with the skill corresponding to the school of the spell.\nStep 2: Defend\r\nThe defender then picks their method of defense and combat\r\nstyle before making the defense test. A character must be aware\r\nof an attack to defend against it, and must choose to defend\r\nbefore the attacker has rolled.\n                 Evade: The defender rolls an Evade test (Agility). \r\n                 Parry: Melee weapons or shields may be used to parry \n\nmelee attacks. The defender makes the Combat Style test\r\nusing Strength or Agility.\r\nBlock: Shields may be used to block ranged or melee attacks.\r\nThe defender makes a Combat Style test using Strength.\r\nCounter-Attack: The characters both attempt to strike the\r\nother while parrying their opponents blows. The defender\r\nalso makes a melee attack, using the rules above. Both\r\ncharacters count as attackers in step 3.\nStep 3: Roll Tests &amp; Determine Result\r\nIf one character is able to gain a significant advantage over their\r\nmelee opponent, they are said to have gained an Advantage.\r\nNote that if a defender does not try to defend, or cannot do so,\r\nthey are treated as having automatically failed.\n                Both characters fail: Neither attack nor defense resolves.\n\n1 character fails: The winner gains an advantage (if melee).\r\nAttacker wins: The attack is successful, the attacker\r\nchooses how to utilize their advantage, and resolves it.\r\nDefender wins: The defense is successful, the defender\r\nchooses how to utilize their advantage and resolves it.\n    Both characters pass: No characters gain an advantage.\r\nAttack vs. Block: The defender blocks the attack \n\nregardless of attacker degrees of success. Resolve the\r\nblock using the rules in Step 4 as if the defender won.\n  Attack vs. Parry or Evade: The defense is negated if the \n\nattacker has more degrees of success. Resolve the attack.\r\nCounter-Attack: Whichever character achieves more\r\ndegrees of success hits the other. If both characters\r\nachieve the same degrees of success, then neither the\r\nAttack nor the Counter-Attack resolve.\nCritical Success/Failure\r\nIf one character critically succeeded, treat it as if they succeeded\r\nwith more DoS than their opponent (if their opponent suc-\r\nceeded at all). They also gain an advantage. If one character rolls\r\na critical failure, and their opponent passed, then their opponent\r\ncounts as having critically succeeded. If one character critically\r\nsucceeds and the other fails, or one succeeds and one critically\r\nfails, then the character who succeeded gains two advantages,\r\nwhich can stack if applicable. If both sides roll a critical success\r\nor failure, then no advantage is gained, and neither attack nor\r\ndefense resolves.\nOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in\r\nPhysical Health later in this chapter, then an attack\r\nresulting in a critical success causes a wound to the hit\r\nlocation of the attack.\nStep 4: Resolve Attack &amp; Advantages\r\nFinally, resolve the attack based on the result.\nHit Locations\nResult\nLocation Hit\n1-5\nBody\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0\nRight Leg\nLeft Leg\nRight Arm\nLeft Arm\nHead\nAttacker Won\r\nThe attack hits the target and\r\ndeals damage. If the targets\r\narmor values differ across hit\r\nlocations, then check to see\r\nwhere  it  hit  using  the  ones\r\ndigit of the attack roll or a d10\r\n(count 10 as 0). (You can often\r\nskip this step entirely or delay it\r\nuntil it is necessary).\nNext, resolve any advantage gained from the combat roll (see\r\nthe next page). Then roll the damage of the attack and subtract\r\nthe Armor Rating (AR) of the hit location struck. Reduce the\r\ntargets HP by the remaining amount. Some types of AR only\r\nmitigate certain types of damage. If the damage dealt after\r\nreduction exceeds the targets Wound Threshold, the attack has\r\nalso caused a wound. See Physical Health for details.\n101\n\fOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in\r\nPhysical Health later in this chapter, then the attack\r\ninstead causes a Wound if it brings the target to 0 HP or\r\nif the attack is a Critical Success and causes the target to\r\ntake Damage.\n          Defender won\n\nIf the defender won an advantage, resolve it first:\n                 Evade: If an attack is evaded it is negated entirely. The \n\ncharacter may move up to 1 meter in any direction for free.\r\nThis movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.\r\nParry: If an attack is parried it is negated entirely.\r\nBlock: If an attack is blocked, roll the damage of the attack.\r\nIf the damage exceeds the shields Block Rating against that\r\ndamage type, then the character takes the full damage to\r\ntheir shield arm. Otherwise no damage is taken. Magic\r\ndamage treats BR as half (round up) unless there is a\r\nmagic BR.\nShould there be multiple defenders against a single attack, only\r\none defender gains a defensive advantage.\nAdvantage\r\nCharacters with advantage may utilize it in the following ways:\r\nPrecision Strike (attack only): Choose the hit location\r\nof the attack.\r\nPenetrate Armor (attack only): Treat full armor as partial\r\nand partial as unarmored for the purposes of resolving an\r\nattack. This does not affect AR.\r\nPress Advantage (attack only): Character gains a +10 to\r\ntheir next melee attack against the opponent within 1 round.\r\nForceful Impact (attack only): The character can apply\r\nthe Damaged(1) quality to one armor piece or shield on\r\nthe hit location of the attack.\r\nOverextend (block/evade/parry only): The opponents\r\nnext attack test within 1 round is made at a -10 penalty.\r\nOverwhelm: Your attack or defense engages your oppo-\r\nnents attention completely. The opponent cannot take\r\nattacks of opportunity until the attacking characters next\r\nturn.\r\nSpecial Advantage: Immediately take a special advantage\r\nthat is listed in the characters Combat Style. Ignore the\r\nAP cost, or automatically win any opposed roll involved.\nUnusual Combat Scenarios\r\nThere are several odd combat scenarios characters may find\r\nthemselves in.\nClimbing\r\nA climbing character has all of their combat skill tests limited\r\nby their Athletics skill rank. Characters are limited to fighting\r\nwith a single limb, unless they have extras.\nSlippery Surfaces\r\nA character fighting on slippery or wobbling surfaces has all\r\ncombat tests limited by their Acrobatics skill (if they have a\r\nhigher Combat Style rank, they treat it as their Acrobatics rank\r\ninstead). If the character fails a combat roll in these circum-\r\nstances, they must pass an Acrobatics test or fall prone.\nSwimming\r\nA swimming character has their combat tests limited by their\r\nAthletics skill (if they have a higher Combat Style rank, they\r\ntreat it as their Athletics rank instead). Attacks deal half damage.\nHolding your Breath\r\nA character can hold their breath for 12 seconds (2 rounds in\r\ncombat) per Endurance Bonus they have.\r\nThis duration is doubled if the character does nothing but hold\r\ntheir breath (no action or movement allowed).\r\nFor every round beyond the characters Endurance Bonus\r\nholding their breath, the character gains a temporary level of\r\nfatigue until they die or regain access to fresh air, after which\r\nthe temporary fatigue is removed at a rate of 1 per round.\nSwinging or Jumping\r\nA character swinging or jumping into (or out of ) combat has\r\ntheir combat tests limited by their Acrobatics skill (if they have a\r\nhigher Combat Style rank, they treat it as their Acrobatics rank\r\ninstead). If the character fails a combat roll they must pass an\r\nAcrobatics test or fall prone and suffer appropriate fall damage.\n102\n\fMelee Combat\r\nMelee combat is any combat that happens within several meters,\r\nwhere participants fight either with wielded or natural weapons.\r\nThe melee weapons a character can use are listed as part of their\r\nCombat Style skills.\nMelee Combat Circumstance Modifiers\r\nLike all tests, tests made in melee combat should always be\r\nsubject to difficulty based on the environment or circumstances\r\nin which the combat is happening. Disadvantageous circum-\r\nstances can be rated in a simple scale by the GM and should\r\nnot usually be worse than -30. The table below provides the\r\nscale and some examples.\nMelee Combat Circumstance Modifiers\nModifier\nCommon Examples\nMinor Disadvantage (-10)\nFighting in poor visibility.\nDisadvantage (-20)\nFighting from lower ground or prone.\nMajor Disadvantage (-30)\nFighting blind.\nMounted Combat\r\nMounted combat functions like normal combat, but with a\r\nfew key differences:\n Mounted characters can evade ranged attacks but only while \n\nmoving. They cannot evade melee attacks (except those\r\nfrom other mounted characters), though their mount can.\r\nMounted characters may parry or Counter-Attack in\nresponse to attacks against their mount.\r\nMounted characters use their mounts Speed.\n   The GM may rule that ranged attacks that miss the char-\n\nacter or their mount hit the other target instead.\nMultiple Opponents\r\nFacing multiple opponents can be dangerous. While a character\r\nsuffers no direct penalties for doing so, they can soon become\r\nswamped and run out of action points with which to defend\r\nthemself. Remember that once all their AP for a round have\r\nbeen expended the character is treated as having failed their\r\ndefense roll against any subsequent attacks, meaning they\r\nquickly becomes vulnerable to the others.\nDual Wielding\r\nSome characters fight with two one handed weapons at once as\r\na part of their Combat Style and may choose to attack, parry,\r\nor Counter-Attack with either one.\nCover\r\nCover is used by characters to obstruct attacks against them,\r\neither in ranged or close combat. This occurs by either physically\r\nblocking a blow or by obscuring the exact location of the target.\nIf the character is incapable of seeing their target, they simply\r\ncannot attack them unless they have another way of knowing\r\nthat they are there. Otherwise they suffer a circumstance penalty\r\nto attack targets who are trying to use cover that their attack\r\ncannot penetrate based on the GMs judgment of the level of\r\nthe cover.\nIf the target is protected by cover that the attack can penetrate\r\nwith relative ease, the attacker suffers no penalty to hit but rolls\r\ntwice and chooses the lower value for damage.\n103\n\fImprovised Weaponry\r\nIn certain cases a character might find themselves forced to fight\r\nusing improvised weaponry. Attacks with improvised weapons\r\nsuffer the usual -20 untrained penalty unless the characters\r\nCombat Style includes improvised weapons. The table below\r\nprovides a set of guidelines for the GM.\nImprovised Weaponry Guidelines\nType\nTiny\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nHuge\nDamage\nRange\n1d4\n1d6\n1d8\n1d10\n1d12\n1m (gain Small quality)\n1m\n2m\n3m\n4m\nThe GM should feel free to give certain improvised weapons\r\nappropriate weapon qualities based on the type of object.\nUnarmed Combat\r\nUnarmed combat is when a character fights using their natural\r\nweapons. Characters are always capable of attempting to fight\r\nin this manner, even if they do not have unarmed combat as\r\npart of their Combat Style. Characters attempt a Combat Style\r\ntest using Strength or Agility with the standard -20 penalty for\r\nusing an untrained skill, if applicable.\nA characters natural weapons use the profile specified below\r\nunless the character has the Natural Weapons (*) trait (which\r\noverrides the default profile). If a character has a Combat Style\r\nthat includes unarmed combat, that skill can be used for attacks\r\nwith the characters natural weapons. Natural weapons ignore\r\nrules regarding one, two, or hand and a half weapons, and\r\ncannot be disarmed. Natural Weapons cannot be enchanted.\nDefault Natural Weapon Profiles\nType\nDamage\nRange\nPunches/Kicks\n1d4\nClaws\n1d4; Slashing\n1m\n1m\nParrying/Counter-Attacking while Unarmed\r\nIf an unarmed combatant is facing an opponent with a weapon\r\nwith a longer range and they are within their own engagement\r\nrange, then they can attempt to parry that weapons attacks or\r\nCounter-Attack. Otherewise melee attacks cannot be parried\nor countered by unarmed characters.\nGrappling\r\nIn place of making a normal attack a character can choose to\r\nattempt to grapple their opponent. This requires a Combat Style\r\ntest (the style must include unarmed combat) opposed against\neither a Combat Style (with unarmed), Athletics, or Evade test.\r\nOn success, the target gains the restrained condition. The target\r\nmay attempt to escape by using the resist action. On success\r\nthey break free.\nCharacters suffer a -30 penalty when attempting to grapple\r\ncharacters of larger size than them, and they cannot grapple\r\ncharacters of two or more sizes larger. While they have an oppo-\r\nnent restrained, the character may not move but may take the\r\nfollowing actions (each is a primary action that costs 1 AP):\nTakedown: The character may render their victim, and\r\nthemself, prone. They suffer no prone penalties in relation\r\nto any tests made against their target.\r\nMove: The character may move themself and their victim\r\na number of meters up to their Strength bonus in any\r\ndirection.\n Attack: The character may make a normal attack against \n\ntheir restrained victim, who cannot defend themself. They\r\nmust use a weapon with a 1m range or less. If the target\r\nis both prone and restrained and the character is armed,\r\nthis can be a coup de grce. If the character is unarmed,\r\nthen they can choose to instead cause the target to lose 1\r\nStamina point.\n104\n\f105\n\fRanged Combat\r\nRanged combat is any form of combat that happens at a distance\r\nwith weapons which must be shot, thrown, or slung at their\r\ntarget. The ranged weapons a character can use are listed as part\r\nof their Combat Style skills.\nRanged attacks are resolved similarly to melee attacks, except\r\nthey cannot be parried or Counter-Attacked. Ranged attackers\r\ncannot gain or utilize advantage. Ranged weapons have  unique\r\nattributes that distinguish them from melee weapons:\nRange for ranged weapons is defined in terms of three numbers\r\ninstead of just one, representing the maximum close, effective,\r\nand long ranges of the weapon. Attacking targets in close range\r\nprovides a +10 bonus to attack tests with the weapon, while\r\nattacking targets at long range imposes a -20 penalty.\nReload represents the number of AP required to reload a\r\nweapon which fires ammunition. This requires the use of the\r\nready action.\nRanged Combat Circumstance Modifiers\r\nLike all tests, tests made in ranged combat should always be\r\nsubject to difficulty based on the environment or circumstances\r\nin which the combat is happening. Disadvantageous circum-\r\nstances can be rated in a simple scale by the GM and should\r\nnot usually be worse than -30. The table below provides the\r\nscale and some examples.\nRanged Combat Circumstance Modifiers\nModifier\nCommon Examples\nMinor Disadvantage (-10)\nFiring in light wind\nDisadvantage (-20)\nFiring in moderate wind, target prone\nMajor Disadvantage (-30) Firing in heavy wind or low visibility\nFiring while Mounted\r\nA character can use ranged weapons even while mounted, how-\r\never their Combat Style skill is limited by the Ride skill of the\r\npersonal controlling the mount (if their Combat Style rank\r\nexceeds their Ride skill rank, use their Ride skill rank instead).\nArea of Effect Attacks\r\nSome ranged attacks, typically spells, affect an area. Area of\r\neffect attacks that cause damage can only be defended against\r\nby evading or blocking and only if the character is aware of the\r\nincoming attack.\nOn a successful Block, the character halves the incoming damage\r\n(round up) before resolving the effects. On a successful evade,\r\nthe character may move a single meter in any direction as normal\r\nwithout provoking any Attacks of Opportunity. If this would\r\ncarry them outside the range of the area of effect, they are not\r\naffected.\nArea of effect attacks are resolved against the body.\n106\n\fCombat Example\r\nThis page contains an example of a short combat exchange using\r\nthe rules discussed thus far:\nThe Scene\r\nDeep in a frozen cave in the northern reaches of Skyrim, a lone\r\nhero squares off against a mighty troll. The hero is lightly armored,\r\nwielding only a simple broadsword and shield.\nRound 1\r\nBoth characters roll initiative. The troll rolls an 8, and the hero\r\nrolls a 12. Both characters have 3 maximum Action Points.\nThe hero has the first turn, and moves forward a few meters so that\r\nthey are within their two meter melee range (determined by their\r\nbroadswords range stat) of the troll. They decide to take the attack\r\naction (1 AP), against which the Troll reacts by Counter-Attacking\r\n(1 AP). The hero rolls a Combat Style [Nord Champion] test with\r\na +30 bonus (for a TN of 75) due to their rank in the skill. The\r\ntroll also rolls their own attack test.\nThe hero passes with 4 degrees of success (roll of 43), and the troll\r\npasses with 2 degrees of success (roll of 26). No advantage is gained,\r\nbut the hero is able to land a hit as the two exchange blows (due to\r\nrolling higher DoS). They resolve the effects of the hit against the\r\ntrolls body (due to the 3 in their roll) and rolls damage. The troll\r\ntakes a total of 8 damage from the strike.\nboth characters have spent 1 AP. It is still the Heros turn.\r\nThe hero decides to press the attack, and makes another attack, this\r\ntime they go all out (2 AP for an All Out Attack, giving them a +20\r\nbonus to their attack) and the troll attempts a Counter-Attack (1\r\nAP). The hero makes a mistake and opens themself up, failing their\r\nattack test while the troll still manages to roll 6 degrees of success (roll\r\nof 61) on their attack test. Because the hero failed while the troll\r\nsucceeded, the troll not only lands a blow but gains an advantage.\r\nThe troll utilizes this advantage to knock the hero to the ground,\r\ntaking the trip special action and auto-winning the opposed roll\r\nto render the hero prone (this costs 1 AP). They then resolve the\r\ndamage from the hit, and the hero takes 9 damage from the blow.\nAt this point the hero is prone, is out of AP, and their opponent is\r\nalso out of AP. The round ends, and a new round begins…\nRound 2\r\nThe hero takes the first turn, having higher initiative. They use\r\nhalf of their total speed in movement in order to stand up, and\r\nthe troll takes advantage of this opening to make an attack of\r\nopportunity (1 AP). The hero is injured, and so opts to play\r\ndefensively, raising their shield in an attempt to block the attack\r\n(1 AP). The troll passes their attack test with 4 degrees of success,\r\nand the hero passes their defense test with only 3, but this is still\r\nenough for them to interpose their shield between their body\r\nand the blow. The troll rolls damage, and the 8 damage is not\r\nenough to overcome the BR of the heros shield, so the blow slides\r\noff harmlessly…\nAt this point one character has attacked, and the other reacted, so\nThe hero, now standing, presses the attack…\n107\n\fRunning Smooth Combats\r\nThis page provides some visual examples to help players under-\r\nstand how they might utilize battle grids and other tools to\r\nmake combat run as smoothly as possible.\nUsing a Grid\r\nThe creators of the UESRPG highly recommend the use of a\r\nbattle map or grid when running combat encounters. A grid\r\nhelps players to understand their own situation, assists the GM\r\nin keeping track of the big picture, and makes understanding\r\nthe consequences of combat ranges much easier.\nThe easiest way to use the UESRPG with a grid is to assume\r\nthat each grid square represents a square meter. Two characters\r\ncannot share the same grid square, though characters can be\r\nallowed to pass through another characters square if both parties\r\nare willing. The system also functions just fine on a hex grid.\nIf you are using an online grid or map system that supports\r\nauras (as displayed in the example pictures) then using auras\r\ncan be a good way to help players visualize their weapon ranges.\nTracking Initiative &amp; AP\r\nOne of the trickiest parts of running combat can be tracking\r\nhow much AP a given character has remaining for the round. We\r\nadvise GMs track this by simply tallying next to each character\r\n(PCs and NPCs) name on an initiative ordered list/table each\r\ntime that character takes an action or reaction. This allows the\r\nGM to easily see who can still react and who has AP left with\r\nwhich to take a turn.\n1\n2\nVisuals Examples\r\nAbove, the red mercenary wields a 2m range weapon (yellow\r\naura) outside the 2m range (green aura) of the blue mercenary.\r\nThey then move into the edge of their opponents range. Both\r\nmercenaries can attack the other at this range.\nBelow, the red mercenary wields a 1m range weapon at the\r\nedge of the 3m range of the blue mercenary. Stepping any\r\ncloser triggers an opportunity attack from the blue mercenary,\r\nbut doing so is necessary for them to enter melee range (right).\n1\n2\n108\n\fphySiCal health\nDuring the course of the players adventures, it is very likely\r\nthat they will suffer injury of some kind. The following sections\r\nexplain how to handle damage, fatigue, wounds, and death.\nDamage &amp; Hit Locations\r\nDamage represents the ability of an attack to harm a character.\r\nAttacks against a character always strike a particular hit location,\r\nand the damage of that attack is reduced by the Armor Rating\r\n(AR) of that hit location. The Hit Location of an attack is usually\r\ndetermined by the 1s digit of the attack roll, but can also be\r\ndetermined by rolling 1d10 (counting 10 as 0). The characters\r\nHealth Points (HP) are then reduced by the remaining amount.\nHit Locations\nResult\nLocation Hit\n1-5\nBody\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0\nRight Leg\nLeft Leg\nRight Arm\nLeft Arm\nHead\nDamage Types\r\nThe above rules hold true for all physical attacks and physical\r\narmor. However, some attacks and effects can deal other types\r\nof damage that can only be resisted with certain types of armor.\r\nBroadly, damage can be divided into two overall types:\nPhysical Damage\r\nPhysical damage represents physical cuts, jabs, and blows that\r\nharm a character through force of impact or blood loss (or\r\nboth). All normal weapons deal physical damage, and physical\r\ndamage is reduced by normal AR.\nMagic Damage\r\nMagic damage represents damage dealt by magical or elemental\r\nforces, such as burns from a fire ball spell. Poison is included\r\nin this category, though it is not always magical. There are\r\nsub-types of magic damage, each reduced by a corresponding\r\narmor type (and also reduced by generic magic AR).\nMagic Damage Types\nSub-Type\nArmor Type\n(Any)\nMagic\nFire\nFrost\nShock\nMagic AR\nMagic AR\nFire AR\nFrost AR\nShock AR\nSub-Type\nArmor Type\nPoison\nShadow\nPoison AR\n\n\n\nResolving Magic Damage vs Specific Damage\r\nWhen resolving specific damage types against resistance or weak-\r\nness traits, the more specific value for the trait takes precedence.\nFor example: Jefe (pronounced Geoff) of the imperial guard is\r\nfending off a horde of zombies as they fall upon the city gates.\r\nZombies have Resistance (Magic, 1) and Weakness (Fire, 3). Jefe\r\nsuccessfully casts Fire Bolt and rolls 5 for damage. When the spell\r\naffects the zombie, the Weakness (Fire, 3) trait is applied to the\r\ndamage without applying the resistance to magic resulting in a\r\ntotal of 8 fire damage being applied.\nDeath\r\nIf a character is reduced to 0 Health Points remaining, then\r\nthey fall unconscious. A character who is unconscious at 0 HP\r\nmust pass an Endurance test at the end of each of their turns. If\r\nthey fail a number of tests in excess of their Luck bonus while\r\nunconscious, then they die. Taking damage at least once causes\r\nthe character to fail the next test. If an effect would Stabilize\r\nthem (this can be done with a Survival or Profession [Medicine]\r\nskill test and a healers kit) or bring them above 0 HP, then\r\nthey stop testing.\nYoure not gonna kill me!\nLokir of Rorikstead, moments before death\nWounds\r\nWounds represent devestating injuries caused by more damaging\r\nattacks, and not just simple cuts and bruises. If a character ever\r\ntakes damage from a single attack in excess of their Wound\r\nThreshold (WT), then they take a wound. Record the amount\r\nof damage and hit location, then follow these steps:\nShock Effects\r\nFirst, the character must make a special Endurance test known\r\nas a Shock Test, which represents how well the character fares\r\nagainst the initial effects.\n        If the wound is to the body, the character loses an action \n\npoint. If they have none remaining, they begin the next\r\nround with one less. If they fail the shock test then they\r\nalso suffer the crippled body condition.\r\nIf the wound is to a limb, the character suffers the crippled\r\nlimb condition (blows to the head instead stun for 1 round).\r\nIf they fail the shock test, then they also suffer the lost limb\r\ncondition (lost ear or lost eye for the head).\nIf the wound was caused by magic damage, the following applies:\n109\n\f\n       If the wound is from fire damage, the character also must \n\npass a Strength or Agility test or gain the Burning (1)\r\ncondition.\r\nIf the wound is from magic, frost, or poison damage, the\r\ncharacter also loses a Stamina point.\r\nIf the wound is from shock damage, the character also loses\r\nMagicka points equal to the damage inflicted.\nOptional Rule Note: Turn Based AP Refreshing\r\nIf youre using the alternate ruleset for AP refreshing,\r\nmodify the text in the body Shock Effect from they\r\nbegin the next round with one less to they begin their\r\nnext turn with one less.\nPassive Effects\r\nAfter the shock test has been resolved, the character suffers a -20\r\nto all tests and a -2 to future initiative rolls until the wound is\r\nfully healed. The character has 30 seconds (5 rounds) before they\r\ndrop to 0 HP through blood loss. These effects can be removed\r\nby first aid (a Survival or Profession [Medicine] skill test must\r\nbe performed, which takes 1 turn and requires a healers kit or\r\nother supplies), or delayed with magical healing (see below).\nOptional Rule: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf your group prefers less bookkeeping and a more\r\nforgiving experience, you can use this rule instead of the\r\nstandard rules for Wounds:\r\nInstead of a character taking a Wound when they take\r\ndamage in excess of their WT, they take a wound if  they\r\never take damage from a critical success on an attack or if\r\nan attack reduces them to 0 Health Points.\nHealing\r\nThere are two means by which characters can heal damage and\r\nwounds which have been dealt to them: natural healing, and\r\nmagic healing.\nRestoring HP\r\nBoth magical and natural healing can restore missing HP.\nMagical Healing\r\nMagical healing will always specify an amount of missing HP\r\nthat it restores, and this happens instantly unless otherwise noted.\nNatural Healing\r\nCharacters naturally regenerate a number of missing HP equal\r\nto their Endurance bonus each time they take a long rest as long\r\nas they have no untreated wounds. This amount is doubled if\r\nthe character is not doing anything strenuous and is focused\r\nentirely on healing themselves (or if another person is caring\r\nfor them).\nHealing Wounds\r\nIn order for a character to begin to heal wounds, those wounds\r\nmust be treated first. If a wound is not treated within a number\r\nof days equal to the characters Endurance bonus, the charac-\r\nter becomes Maimed: any body parts crippled by the wound\r\nbecome crippled permanently and count as being lost.\nHealing Untreated Wounds\r\nCharacters cannot regenerate HP naturally while they have\r\nuntreated wounds. In addition to restoring HP, magical\r\nhealing done while the character is wounded temporarily\r\nremoves the passive effects and forestalls unconsciousness for\r\na number of rounds equal to the amount healed. If a charac-\r\nter ever heals to full HP while they have an untreated wound,\r\nthey become maimed as the wound has healed improperly.\nTreating Wounds\r\nA wound can be treated by a successful Profession [Medicine]\r\ntest, which takes approximately an hour. Once a characters\r\nwound(s) have been treated, they can begin to heal naturally\r\nagain. Treating a wound related to the Crippled Condition can\r\nonly be done once per long rest. If this test results in a dramatic\r\nfailure, the limb immediately becomes Maimed.\nCuring Wounds\r\nOnce a wound has been treated it can be properly healed. After\r\ntreatment if a character regenerates HP (by magical or natural\r\nmeans) equal to or in excess of the damage that caused the\r\nwound, then the wound and all of its effects are removed. The\r\none exception is that characters cannot heal lost limbs in this\r\nfashion.\nConditions\r\nConditions are things that externally affect the character and\r\ntheir capabilities instead of features of the characters nature.\nBleeding (X)\r\nReduce Wound Threshold by 1. At the end of the characters\r\nnext turn, they take X damage (bypass AR/resistance); then X\r\nis reduced by 1. If the character regains HP from any source,\r\nsubtract the total HP regained (including HP that would go\r\nbeyond the characters maximum HP) from X.\nBleeding can also be reduced by making a Profession[Medicine]\n+0 skill test and using a Healers Kit. Reduce X by the DoS of\r\nthe test. The Healers Kit is not consumed in the process.\nIf X ever becomes 0, the Bleeding condition is removed.\nIf the Bleeding(X) condition would be inflicted on a character\r\nthat already has a Bleeding condition, the value of each is added\r\ntogether and replaces the current Bleeding condition.\n110\n\fOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf your group is using the optional rule for wounds,\r\nreplace the text Reduce Wound Threshold by 1.\r\nwith Characters take a -10 penalty to Shock Tests..\nDeafened\r\nThe character loses the ability to hear. Deafened characters\r\ncannot hear anything and automatically fail tests that rely on\r\nhearing.\nBlinded\r\nThe character loses all vision and suffer the following penalties:\n                 Cannot see anything.\r\n                 Suffers a -30 to tests benefitting from sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Automatically fail any tests that rely solely on sight.\n\nBurning (X)\r\nThe target is engulfed in flames, with the intensity of the fire\r\ndetermined by a number X.\n                 Start of Turn: At the end of each of their turns, a burning \n\ncharacter suffers a single hit of X fire damage to the appro-\r\npriate hit location (body is the default). Then increase X\r\nby 1.\r\nStacking Burning: If a second instance of burning is\r\ninflicted on a character, simply combine the two X values.\r\nTaking Action: A burning character must pass a Willpower\r\ntest with a -20 penalty at the beginning of a turn in order\r\nto attempt any action other than putting out the fire.\r\nPutting It Out: A burning character can attempt to extin-\r\nguish the flames on their turn by spending an action point\r\nand making an Strengrh or Agility test with a +20 bonus\r\nand a -10 penalty for every point of the X value beyond\n\nThe burning character becomes prone and, if the test\r\nsucceeds, loses the burning condition.\n\nChameleon (X)\r\nA character with this condition blends into their environment.\r\nSight based tests to detect this character are made with a -X\r\npenalty. Only apply the highest value version of this condition\r\nif a character would receive it more than once.\nCrippled Body Part\r\nA piece of the characters body has been rendered temporarily\r\nuseless. Multiple instances of this condition can affect a character\r\nat once as long as each affects a different hit location and/or\r\nthe body parts associated with that hit location. Any body part\r\nthat has been crippled suffers all the same penalties as if it had\r\nbeen lost. Use Lost Eye or Lost Ear if the head location has\r\nbeen crippled and the Organ Damage condition if the body\r\nlocation has been crippled.\nDazed\r\nThe character gains one less action point at the beginning of\r\neach round, to a minimum of one.\nEntangled\r\nThe character makes all Combat Style tests with a -20 penalty\r\nand their movement speed is halved (round up).\nFatigued\r\nWhen a chracter gains a level of fatigue, they acquire the Fatigued\r\ncondition. If they gain additional levels of fatigue, the effects\r\nworsen. Fatigue is most typically gained when a character falls\r\nbelow 0 SP or spends/loses SP when they are at 0.\nFatigue Effects\nLevels\nEffects\nFatigued (1)\n-10 penalty to all tests.\nExhausted (2)\n-20 penalty to all tests.\nDrained (3)\n-30 penalty to all tests\nUnconscious (4) Characters falls unconscious\n5+\nCharacter dies\nFrenzied\r\nThe character is flung into an uncontrollable rage. Frenzied\r\ncharacters gain the following rules:\n                 Must attempt to attack the nearest person or creature in \n\nmelee combat each turn if able, using only All Out Attacks.\r\nIf not within range of a potential target, the character must\r\nmove toward the nearest potential target. They may not\r\nattempt to flee the fight.\r\nIncrease WT by 3 and SB by 1.\nOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds, disregard\r\nthe WT increase in this bullet point.\n                 Suffer a -20 penalty to all skill tests based on anything \n\nexcept Strength, Agility, or Endurance.\r\nGain an extra SP, which can exceed their SP maximum.\r\nImmune to the effects of the stunned condition, fear, and\r\npassive wound effects.\nOnce the encounter has ended, the character snaps out of their\r\nfrenzied state and loses 2 SP (this cannot kill them). The charac-\r\nter can also test Willpower at a -20 as an action during combat\r\nto attempt to snap out of frenzy, which ends the condition.\nHidden\r\nThe character is hidden from enemies and moving stealthily.\r\nCharacters must spend 2 meters of their movement for the\r\nround for each 1 meter that they actually move while hidden,\n111\n\fand they cannot Dash. Enemies cannot attempt to defend\r\nthemselves against the attacks of hidden characters, but attacking\r\ncauses a character to lose this condition immediately afterwards.\nIf a hidden character would enter line of sight of at least one\r\ncharacter from whom they have not previously hidden, they\r\nmust make a Stealth test opposed by that characters Observe.\r\nOn success, or if they achieve more degrees of success, they\r\nremain hidden. Otherwise that character becomes aware of them.\nImmobilized\r\nImmobilized characters cannot move. They may still attack and\r\ntake other actions and can defend themselves.\nInvisible\r\nInvisible characters cannot be seen. Characters fail all sight\r\nrelated tests related to spotting the Invisible character and\r\nattack them at a -30 penalty, assuming they can guess where\r\nthe character might be in the first place.\nLost Body Part\r\nThe character loses a part of their body. A character can have\r\nmultiple instances of this condition at once, each affecting a\r\ndifferent body part. If an attack would hit a body part that has\r\nbeen entirely lost, the attack hits the body location instead. This\r\ncondition applies additional penalties that vary based on the\r\nbody part. In the case of the head, there is a choice between\nan ear or an eye (GMs decision).\nLost Ear\r\nThe character has had their ear removed or destroyed and their\r\nhearing damaged. They suffer the following penalties:\n                  All tests that rely on hearing are made with a -20 penalty.\r\n\r\n                If both ears are lost, the character gains the deafened con-\n\ndition permanently.\nLost Eye\r\nThe character has had their eye removed or destroyed and suffers\r\nthe following penalties:\n                  All tests that rely on sight are made with a -20 penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                If both eyes are lost, the character gains the blinded con-\n\ndition permanently.\nLost Foot/Leg\r\nThe character has had their leg severed somewhere between the\r\nankle and the hip and suffers the following penalties.\n                Gain the slowed condition permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  All tests that rely on the use of two legs are made with a \n\n-20 penalty.\r\nIf both legs are lost, gain the Immobilized condition per-\r\nmanently and fail any tests that rely entirely on movement.\nLost Hand/Arm\r\nThe character has had their arm severed somewhere between\r\nthe wrist and the shoulder, and suffers the following penalties:\r\nCan no longer use two-handed weapons, shields (if the\r\nwhole arm is missing), or one handed weapons in that arm.\r\nAll tests that rely on the use of two hands are made with\na -20 penalty.\r\nIf both hands are lost, the character cannot wield weapons\r\nand automatically fails all tests that rely on the use of hands.\nOrgan Damage (Lost Body Part: Body)\r\nThe character has had their internal organs damaged. Characters\r\nwith this condition heal damage at half speed and reduce their\r\nSP maximum and WT by 1.\nOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds; instead of\r\nreducing WT by 1, increase the passive wound penalty to\r\nall tests to -30.\nMuffled (X)\r\nA character with this condition is harder to hear. Hearing based\r\ntests to detect this character are made with a -X penalty. Only\r\napply the highest value version of this condition if a character\r\nwould receive it more than once.\nProne\r\nThe character is prone, and every 1 meter that they move while\r\nprone costs 2 meters of their movement for the round. They\r\nalso suffer a -20 penalty to all combat related tests and count\r\nany full armor they are wearing as partial (to represent that it is\r\neasier for characters to take advantage of gaps in their defenses\r\nwhile they are down).\nDropping prone costs no movement, but standing up requires\r\nthat a character spend movement equal to half of their base\r\nSpeed. If the character does not have this much movement\r\nleft over to use, then they cannot get up unless they take the\r\nArise action.\nParalyzed\r\nThe character is frozen, unable to move any part of their body.\r\nThey may only cast spells that do not require speech or motion.\nRestrained\r\nThe character is restrained and thus unable to move. They also\r\ncannot attack or defend themselves. They may only cast spells\r\nthat do not require motion.\nSilenced\r\nMagically silenced characters believe they are making sound,\r\nbut in reality their words never pass their lips. They suffer the\n112\n\fusual -20 penalty for being unable to speak when casting spells.\r\nAt the start of each round they can roll a Perception test to see\r\nif they realize what is happening.\nSlowed\r\nThe characters Speed is reduced by half (round up).\nfear\r\nWhen a character is confronted by an excessively frightening\r\nevent or adversary, they must make a Fear Test. There are two\r\ntypes of fear tests: panic and horror tests. If the character fails\r\nthe test, they succumb to the effects of fear.\nStunned\r\nThe character immediately loses all remaining action points\r\nupon becoming stunned. Stunned characters do not regain\r\naction points at the start of each round.\nYour GM may call on you to make a Panic Test when you are\r\nconfronted by mundane shock or horror. This is represented\r\nby the Panic (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test\r\nwith a +/- X modifier.\nUnconscious\r\nThe character is knocked out and loses consciousness. They fall\r\nprone if the circumstances allow and may not take actions. If\r\na character gains a level of fatigue while unconscious, they die.\nYour GM may call on you to make a Horror Test when you\r\nare confronted by supernatural terrors. This is represented by\r\nthe Horror (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test\r\nwith a +/- X modifier. In general, horror tests with any sort of\r\npenalty should be reserved for the most terrifying monsters and\nmind melting terrors.\nFear Effects\r\nIf in combat a character fails a fear test, they must immediately\r\nroll a d100 on the appropriate table on the next page. The effects\r\nlisted are applied immediately to the character.\r\nIf in a non-combat situation the character fails a fear test, the\r\ncharacter becomes unnerved and suffers a -20 penalty to any\r\ntests that requires concentration on their part. This penalty\r\nlasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the object\r\nof their fear.\r\nCharacters may be able to shake off some of the effects of fear\r\nafter the initial shock has worn off. The table below will specify\r\ncertain cases where a character can make a Willpower test when\r\nit is their next turn to snap out of their fear. Snapping out\r\nof the fear always happens at the end of their turn.\r\nIf this succeeds, then they regain their senses, shrug off the\r\neffects, and may act normally from then on. If they fail this\r\ntest, the effect continues, and they may try again when it is\r\ntheir next turn.\n113\n\fRoll\nEffect\nCombat Panic Test Results\n01-30\n31-60\n61-90\n91-95\n96-100\nStartled: The character is startled by the source of panic. They jump in their boots and pause for a brief moment as\r\nthey struggle to reassess the situation. They may not make any reactions until the beginning of their next turn.\r\nSpooked: The character gets the shakes from the source of their panic. Fretting, nervous, and full of doubt, they\r\nsuffer a -10 penalty to all tests for the rest of the encounter unless they snap out of it.\r\nFrightened: The character is taken aback, and their teeth clatter in their skull as they inch back from the source of\r\ntheir panic. The character cannot willingly approach the object of their fear, and they suffer a 10 penalty to all tests\r\nuntil the end of the encounter.\r\nLost Composure: The character loses their nerve and freezes in place. Their will to act is decimated by the stress on\r\ntheir mind from the source of their Panic. The character may take no actions until they snap out of it. After snap-\r\nping out of it, the character will make all tests at a 10 penalty for the rest of the encounter.\r\nRunning and Screaming: The character breaks down with fear and flees. They must immediately flee directly away\r\nfrom the source of their fear as fast as they can, which includes ditching equipment slowing them down. They must\r\ndo everything in their power to accomplish this and is at a -20 penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, they\r\nmust successfully snap out of it to regain control, or the encounter must end.\nRoll\nEffect\nCombat Horror Test Results\n1-40\n41-60\n61-80\n81-90\n91-95\n96-99\n100\nMomentary Blackout: The character is so overcome with horror that their mind fails them for a few precious\r\nseconds in the face of this horror. The character drops to the ground unconscious for 1 round and has a -10 penalty\r\nto all actions afterwards for the rest of the encounter.\r\nUncontrollable Vomiting: The characters own body reacts with a gut wrenching sound as the characters innards\r\nempty themselves, and they start vomiting uncontrollably. The character bends over and vomits for 1 round and is\r\nconsidered helpless during this time. Afterwards the character is still nauseous and loses 1 Stamina point immediately.\r\nManic Terror: The Characters mind cracks like a fragile glass sculpture, and they begin to laugh maniacally. Turning\r\nupon the closest nearby friend or foe they start attacking them with whatever weapon they have in their hands at\r\nthe moment. The character can attempt to snap out of it at the start of their first turn each round or be knocked\r\nunconscious to stop their manic rampage. Afterwards the character loses 1d4 Stamina points immediately.\r\nHopeless and Despairing: The character falls to the ground and cries out in despair and terror while shutting out all\r\nother sounds, babbling and mumbling to themselves for comfort for 1d6 rounds. When they regain their senses they\r\nimmediately lose 1d4 Stamina.\r\nBlackout: The characters mind snaps like a twig, unable to truly process the horror of the situation and collapsing\r\ninstead. The character goes catatonic for 1d4 hours and cannot be roused by normal means during this time.\r\nMind Break: The characters will bends as their mind shatters. They drop to the ground while stuttering and\r\nmumbling incomprehensibly for 1d6 rounds. The characters mind is irrepressibly damaged, and they lose either 1d8\r\nWillpower or Personality (players choice) permanently from the harrowing experience. Afterwards for the rest of the\r\nencounter the character cannot attack or approach the source of horror.\r\nScared to Death: The character is so immeasurably overcome with terror and horror that their heart stops beating;\r\nthey must make an Endurance test or die on the spot. Should they succeed, they instead fall catatonic for 1d4 hours\r\nas with Blackout.\n114\n\fMoveMent &amp; Size\nThis section contains more detailed rules for movement, and\r\ncreatures of larger sizes.\nMovement\r\nDuring their turn a character can move before or after taking\r\ntheir action (or both), though they may not move further than\r\ntheir Speed in meters during a single round unless they take\r\nthe Dash action.\nDifficult Terrain\r\nSometimes terrain can be more difficult to traverse than usual,\r\nlike when trudging in water, through a forest, or other similar\r\nterrain. Moving through Difficult Terrain doubles the cost of\r\nmovement, unless the character passes an Athletics or Acrobatics\r\ntest before moving.\nSwim Speed and Climb Speed\r\nMoving while climbing or swimming underwater uses a char-\r\nacters Climb Speed or Swim Speed respectively. Both speeds\r\nare half of their Base Speed (round down) unless otherwise\r\nspecified by a talent or other ability.\nJumping\r\nA character may also make an Acrobatics test to jump over or\r\nup to an obstacle, either horizontally or vertically. This can\r\nrepresent either completely clearing the obstacle or just jumping\r\nhigh enough to grab it with both hands, depending on what the\r\nGM feels is appropriate. If the character does not spend several\r\nseconds running or otherwise preparing (approximately a round)\r\nbefore the jump, then they suffer a -10 penalty to the test.\nWhen jumping vertically, each meter they wish to jump beyond\r\nthe first imposes a -20 penalty on the test. When jumping\r\nhorizontally, each meter they wish to jump beyond the first\r\nimposes a -10 penalty on the test. Critical Failure results in the\r\ncharacter tumbling to the ground.\nFalling\r\nFalling inflicts 1d10+[meters fallen beyond 2] damage to the\r\nbody. This damage ignores armor.\r\nIf a character falls 2m or less and is in control of their body\r\nwhen falling (not tied, paralyzed, unconscious, surprised, etc.),\r\nthey do not take any damage from the fall.\nSize\r\nTamriel is home to creatures of many shapes and sizes. A char-\r\nacters size affects them in a number of critical ways. There are\r\nseven different size categories.\n Puny: This category is reserved for the smallest of creatures \n\nlike kwama foragers, rats, or mice.\n Tiny: This category includes smaller characters like cats \n\nor large cave rats.\n Small: This category includes everything ranging from \n\nquadrupeds like wolves to smaller bipeds like goblins.\r\nStandard: Standard sized characters fall fairly close to the\r\naverage size for man or mer. There are no effects associated\r\nwith this category.\n Large: This category includes characters that are substan-\n\ntially larger than average, including quadrupeds like horses\r\nand larger bipeds like trolls.\n Huge: This category includes very large characters such as \n\ngiants or larger dwemer constructs.\n Enormous: This category is reserved for extremely large \n\ncharacters, like dragons.\nSize To-Hit Effects\nCombat Effects\n-30 to hit by characters of larger size or at range\n-20 to hit by characters of larger size or at range\n-10 to hit at range\nSize\nPuny\nTiny\nSmall\nStandard\n\n\n\nLarge\nHuge\n+10 to hit at range\n+20 to hit by characters of smaller size or at range\nEnormous\n+30 to hit by characters of smaller size or at range\n115\n\fdiSeaSeS\nDiseases are contracted from contact with diseased people,\r\ndiseased animals, or other creatures which are filthy; such as\r\nskeevers or mudcrabs. Sometimes diseases can be caught as\r\nthe result of traps, poisons, or environmental effects, such as\r\nCorprus.\nConsiderations When Using Diseases\r\nSome groups love diseases, as they add opportunity for\r\nadventure and adversity for their characters, as well as pro-\r\nvide a level of realism to their games. They are also useful\r\nto make characters with skill in Profession [Medicine]\r\nand resistance or immunity to disease really shine. Other\r\ngroups might find diseases to be too much to track and\r\nonly useful to add dramatic effect. Others still might\r\ndecide to ignore them altogether.\nIts up to your group and the GM to discuss and decide\r\nhow much of this ruleset to implement for your game.\r\nHowever, keep in mind that some diseases can be\r\nparticularly nasty and might ruin the fun for a player if\r\nthey completely cripple their character with no satisfying\r\nresolution. For this reason, GMs should take care in how\r\nthey implement this ruleset and make sure to provide\r\nsome realistic or interesting path to a cure when needed.\nContracting a Disease\r\nDiseases are contracted after an encounter with a creature with\r\nthe Diseased (+/- X) trait or a magical/environmental effect.\nIn an encounter with creatures, a disease has a chance of being\r\ncontracted when an attack from a Diseased creature causes a\r\nwound. The target of the attack must then successfully test\r\nEndurance +/- X or contract the creatures disease. In an encoun-\r\nter with an effect (magical, environmental, etc), the effect will\r\ndetermine when Endurance is tested to contract the disease\r\nand at what difficulty.\nCommon Diseases\r\nCommon Diseases are caught most often from traps, poisons,\r\nor from fighting Diseased animals or people. Common Diseases\r\nare often spread through contact or bodily fluids, preventing\r\nthem from breaking out into full blown plagues.\nCommon Diseases bear mild social stigma, which can escalate to\r\ndisgust and suspicion in extreme cases. Given the ease of treating\r\nCommon Diseases, only the truly destitute and unfaithful are\r\nafflicted with what is seen as their just due.\nShared Effects of Common Diseases\r\nAll Common Diseases cause the following effects in their victims:\nDiseased (+0)\nGain the Social Stigma (1) Character Trait\nAll Common Diseases can be cured by using any spell level Cure\r\nDisease spell or potion. Any Common Disease can also be cured\r\nby sincere repentance and piousness at a shrine to one of the\r\nEight and One. Infected animals typically ignore the effects of\r\nthe Common Diseases they carry.\nThe Diseases include a d100 result in case you want to random-\r\nize Disease contraction without regard to which creatures are\r\ntypically carriers.\nAfter contraction, a common disease takes effect after the charac-\r\nter takes a long rest or the next morning, whichever comes first.\nAtaxia\r\nd100: 1-10\r\nAtaxia is a common and relatively mild disease found across\r\nthe breadth of Tamriel. Its symptoms include general pain and\r\nsoreness, muscle stiffness, and anemia. Victims of Ataxia are\r\noften pale, groggy, and irritable because of their symptoms.\r\nSome particularly devious bandits and trap-makers are known\r\nto spring vials or lace nails with the bodily fluids of dead animals\r\nthat carry the disease.\nSymptoms:\r\nDrain Agility 5 pts\r\nDrain Strength 5 pts\r\n-10 to Agility-based Subterfuge tests\r\n-10 to Block tests\nCarriers: Cave Rats, Bears, Alit, Giant Spiders, Slaughterfish,\r\nZombies, Traps\nBrain Rot\r\nd100: 11-15\r\nBrain Rot is a progressively worsening, mind affecting disease.\r\nIt dampens the intelligence, intuition, and mental acuity of its\r\nvictims.

They are prone to\r\nrupture at inconvenient times or times of physical exertion.\r\nWhile Blood Lung is not severe, and will not typically worsen, it\r\ndoes open the door for other diseases to take root, and can also\r\nserve as a vector of infection for others via the coughed up blood.\nSymptoms:\r\nDrain Endurance 5 pts\r\nGain 1 level of Fatigue\r\nEvery SP used inflicts the Bleeding(1) condition\nCarriers: Cave Rats, Nix-Hounds\nBlack Heart Blight (Common)\r\nd100: 25-28\r\nBlack Heart Blight, despite being a member of the Blight family\r\nof diseases created by Dagoth Ur, is a both a blight and a\r\ncommon disease and is less severe than its cousins. After the\r\nending of the Blight in 3E 427, Black Heart Blight survived\r\nafter making the jump to undead. It is carried by zombies\r\nexclusively after the destruction of Dagoth Ur, but prior to\r\ntheir death it was also carried by the various blighted beasts\r\nor Corprus monsters of Morrowind. It is an acute disease that\r\nsaps the victims vitality and endurance.

The\r\nfever is short lived but intense, causing intense sweating, fever,\r\nvomiting, and often other unpleasant bodily functions. Red\r\nFever is known to put even the mightiest warrior into fits of\r\nanguish for its brief, but hellish, duration.\nSymptoms:\r\nSucceed a -40 Encumbrance test or become completely\r\ndisabled (but still conscious) by the violent symptoms of the\r\ndisease for 24 hours\nCarriers: Wolves, Dogs, Cave Rats\nAdditional Effects: After three days, this disease is automatically\r\ncured.\nRockjoint\r\nd100: 71-80\r\nRockjoint is a pervasive and ubiquitous disease across Tamriel.\r\nEvery adventurer, noble lord, or peasant farmer has either had\r\nRockjoint or has personally known someone with Rockjoint.\r\nRockjoint swells the knees and elbows with sensitive and painful\r\nfluids that bloat and then stiffen and can lead to total immobility\r\nif left unchecked.\nSymptoms:\r\nDrain Agility 20 pts\r\nReduce StrB by 1\nCarriers: Guar, Alit, Wolves, Cave Rats, Bears, Horkers, Foxes,\r\nTraps, Zombies\nFrostlimb\r\nd100: 51-52\r\nA relatively obscure Disease, Frostlimb causes intense sensations\r\nof coldness within the victims arms and legs, especially their\r\nfingers.

Unlike common diseases,\r\nmagical diseases are much harder to cure and can cause lasting\r\nor even permanent effects on the afflicted character.\nThe social reaction to magical diseases is often more extreme\r\ndue to their unusual physical symptoms, which are beyond\r\nthose of common physical illnesses.\nBlight Diseases\r\nThe greatest, and most obscure, threat is the Blight, a mysterious\r\nweather-like phenomenon emanating from the crater of Dagoth Ur,\r\nwarping and poisoning creatures in its path, and creating diseased\r\nhorrors that attack travelers and outlying settlements.\n\nBerela Andrano\n\nBlight diseases are native to Morrowind and originate from\r\nDagoth Ur and his Blight storms which he unleashed on\r\nMorrowind from deep within Red Mountain in the late second era.\nShared Effects of Magical Diseases\r\nAll Magical Diseases cause the following effects in their victims:\nThese diseases come in two forms; those which cause the host\r\nto waste away, shutting down their internal biology, and those\r\nwhich result in grotesque growths on the subjects body.\nStage One\nStage Two\nStage Three\n\n\nDiseased (+0)\n\n\nSocial Stigma (1)\n\n\nDiseased (-15)\n\n\nSocial Stigma (2)\n\n\nDiseased (-30)\n\n\nSocial Stigma (3)\n\n\nMagical Diseases can generally be cured by any effect (commonly,\r\nspells or potions) which specifies that it cures magical diseases,\r\nunless otherwise stated.\nAll magical diseases have a Disease Progression section which\r\ndefines how the disease will progress through its stages.\nAstral Vapors\r\nThose who suffer from Astral Vapors find themselves weaker\r\nto the effects of magic and have their magicka reserves sapped.\r\nThe Afflicted are often surrounded by magical fungal spores and\r\nmay suffer from minor hallucinations and a general malaise.\nSymptoms (all 3 stages):\r\nWeakness (Magic, 3)\r\nStunted Magicka\r\nDrain Magicka 20 pts\nCarriers: Dread Zombies\nEach blight disease is presented with an entry for its gestation,\r\nwhich is a combination of a duration and a difficulty modifier.\r\nAfter the disease is contracted, the character makes an Endurance\r\ntest after the duration has passed with the listed modifier. If\r\nthey fail this test, the disease progresses to the next stage and\r\nthe duration of the gestation period is reset. On a success, the\r\ndisease does not progress and the character must retest at the\r\nstart of the next day.\nAsh Woe Blight\r\nAsh Woe Blight is an acute blight disease affecting the victims will\r\nand thought processes. It may be contracted from corprus beasts or\r\nother blighted creatures.\r\nGestation: 4 days, -10\r\nStages:\nStage 1: Lose 10 Willpower and Intelligence\r\nStage 2: Lose 15 Willpower and Intelligence\r\nStage 3: Lose 20 Willpower and Intelligence\nAsh Chancre\r\nAsh-Chancre is an acute blight disease affecting the victims behavior.\r\nIt may be contracted from corprus beasts or other blighted creatures.\r\nGestation: 4 days, -10\r\nStages:\nDisease Progression:\r\nThe effects of each subsequent disease stage take hold after the\r\ncharacter takes a long rest or at the next dawn; whichever comes\r\nfirst.\nStage 1: Lose 10 Personality\r\nStage 2: Lose 15 Personality\r\nStage 3: Lose 20 Personality, Gain the Frenzied condition\r\nuntil  cured\n120\n\fTwo. After each success, the next endurance test increases its\r\npenalty by 5 as the pain of the wound increases and the wound\r\nbegins to fester.\nOnce they have progressed to Stage Two, the character continues\r\nmaking increasingly difficult Endurance tests, but now starting\r\nat +0 and increasing in penalty by 10 per success as the festering\r\nof the wound grows.\nDuring Stage Three, resisting the diseases progression becomes\r\nnearly impossible. During Stage Three, resisting the diseases\r\nprogression becomes nearly impossible. The character continues\r\nto test Endurance each dawn, starting at no penalty; but each\r\nsuccessful Endurance test now increases in penalty by 15 until\r\nthe test is failed or the disease is cured.\nOnce an Endurance test to resist progression is failed during\r\nstage three, the character has completed their transition into\r\nbecoming a lycanthrope. They also immediately and painfully\r\ntransform into their beast form, which counts as a use of their\r\ntransformation ability.\nOnce  the  character  has  completed  their  transition  into\r\nLycanthropy, the effects of this disease are no longer active and\r\nthe wound becomes treatable. After this point, the characters\r\nlycanthropy cannot be cured by any commonly known mundane\r\nor magical means.\nBlack-Heart Blight\r\nBlack-Heart Blight is an acute blight disease affecting the victims\r\nstrength and endurance.

There are other strains which result in other\r\nforms of lycanthropes, like werebears and wereboars.\nDuring the three-stage incubation period of the disease, infected\r\ncharacters commonly experience fatigue, muscle and bone pains,\r\nand vivid nightmares. Additionally, the wound that caused the\r\ncontraction will start to fester and cannot be treated through\r\nnormal or magical means unless the disease is cured, or the\r\ncharacter completes their transition into lycanthropy.\nStage One\nStage Two\nStage Three\n\nThe source wound\r\ncannot be treated\n\n-The source wound\r\ncannot be treated\n\n\nGain 1 lvl of\r\nFatigue\n\n\nThe source wound\r\ncannot be treated,\r\nand its passive\r\neffects are doubled\n\n\nGain 2 lvls of\r\nfatigue\n\n\nCarriers: Werewolves, Werebears, Wereboars, and any other\r\nWere-creatures\nDisease Progression:\r\nThe effects of stage one take hold immediately upon contraction.\r\nThen, each dawn following contraction, the character must\r\nsucceed an Endurance test +0 or the disease progresses to Stage\n121\n\fVampiric Diseases\r\nVampiric diseases come in many forms, Porphyric Hemophilia\r\nand Sanguinare Vampiris being the most common. Rarer\r\nstrains of the vampiric disease include Chaotica Vampiris and\r\nNoxiphilic Sanguivoria.\nNo matter the origin, however, these diseases are related in one\r\nprimary aspect in that they progress until the victim transforms\r\nentirely into a vampire. As they progress, they also share the same\r\neffects on their victims: starting with fatigue and a sensitivity\r\nto sunlight and progressing to a full-on sunlight aversion and\r\nan inability to satiate their hunger through normal means. As\r\nthe transition into vampirism progresses, the victim is often\r\nplagued by vivid dreams of consuming blood.\nStage One\nStage Two\nStage Three\n\n\nWeakness (Fire, 3)\n\n\nSun-Scarred (3)\n\n\nGain 1 level of\r\nFatigue\n\n\nWeakness (Fire, 4)\n\n\nSun-Scarred (5)\n\n\nGain 2 levels of\r\nFatigue\n\n\nWeakness (Fire, 6)\n\n\nSun-Scarred (10)\n\n\nEating does not\r\nsatiate hunger\n\n\nCarriers: Vampires\nDisease Progression:\r\nThe effects of Stage One take hold after the character takes a\r\nlong rest or at the next dawn; whichever comes first.\r\nAfter Stage One takes effect, the character must test Endurance\r\n-10 each dawn. If they fail, then the disease progresses to stage\r\ntwo.\nSimilarly, the character must test Endurance each dawn after\r\nStage Two takes effect, but this time, at a -20 penalty. On a\r\nfailure, the disease progresses to Stage Three.\nAt Stage Three, the character must continue to test Endurance\r\neach dawn, but now at a -30 penalty. On a failure, the character\r\ndies painfully as their body succumbs to the illness. Then, after\r\n1d4 days, they arise again, fully transformed into a vampire.\nAt any time during Stage Three, the afflicted character can\r\nchoose to succumb to the transformation by consuming the\r\nblood of any creature with a Black Soul (generally, sentient\r\nraces) that does not have the undead or undying trait.\nOnce the character has completed their transformation, the\r\neffects of this disease are no longer active. After this point, the\r\ncharacters vampirism cannot be cured by any commonly known\r\nmundane or magical means. See the\nCurses\r\nCharacters whose lycanthropic or vampiric diseases are brought\r\nto full-term become cursed by their affliction. Sometimes those\r\naffected by these curses see them as a blessing rather than a curse.\r\nThis, as with many things, is a matter of perspective considering\r\nthat both vampirism and lycanthropy offer those afflicted with\r\ngreat boons alongside their considerable drawbacks.\nLycanthropy\r\nLycanthropy comes in many forms on Tamriel, but by far the\r\nmost common are werewolves, werebears, and wereboars. When\r\na characters lycanthropic disease is allowed to fully gestate, the\r\ncharacter becomes a lycanthrope with the strain of the lycan-\r\nthropy which caused the original disease contraction.\nThe Transition\r\nOnce a character has completed the transition into lycanthropy,\r\nthey gain the following:\r\nSilver-Scarred (2)\r\nImmunity (Disease)\r\nRestless: The character is plagued by difficulty with sleep.\r\nThey only restore half the health, magicka, and stamina\r\nthey normally would while resting.\nAdditionally, they gain the following according to their lycan-\r\nthropy strain:\nWerewolf\n+5 Strength\r\n+5 Endurance\r\n+10 Agility\r\n+10 perception\r\nNatural Toughness (2)\nWereboar\n+5 Strength\r\n+15 Endurance\r\n+5 Agility\r\n+5 perception\r\nNatural Toughness (4)\nWerebear\n+10 Strength\r\n+10 Endurance\r\n+5 Agility\r\n+5 perception\r\nNatural Toughness (3)\n122\n\fThe Beast Form\r\nWhen a lycanthrope transforms into their beast form, they drop\r\nall of their gear. Any worn armor at the time of transformation\ngains the Damaged (1) quality. Then, they gain the following:\r\nRestore up to their max SP plus an additional 2 SP over\r\ntheir max. SP in excess of their SP max is lost when the\r\ntransformation ends.\nIncrease max HP (not current HP) by 10.\r\nDouble the lycanthropes Natural Toughness and Silver-\nLastly, they gain a new skill at rank 0:\nBestial Instinct (Str, Ag, Prc)\r\nThis skill represents the lycanthropes instinctual abilities while\r\nin beast form. Unlike other skills, ranks in this skill can only\r\nbe increased through the purchase of talents and cannot be\r\npurchased directly. Only while they are in their beast form,\r\nthe lycanthrope can choose to test this skill instead of any of\r\nthe following, using the appropriate governing characteristic:\nUnarmed Combat Style\r\nEvade\r\nSurvival\r\nStealth\r\nAtheltics\r\nAcrobatics\r\nNavigate\r\nObserve\nScarred traits\r\nDark Sight trait\r\nQuadruped trait\r\nStrong Jaws trait\r\nPenalties from jumping are halved.\nAdditionally, they gain the following according to their lycan-\r\nthropy strain:\nWerewolf\nNatural Weapons (Fangs, 1d8 Splitting)\r\nNatural Weapons (Claws, 1d10 Slashing)\r\nLatch On (1 SP):  If the werewolf successfully bites a target\r\nwhich results in a grapple, it latches on with all its strength,\r\ncounting the bitten Hit Location as Crippled. This lasts\r\nuntil the grapple is broken.\nWereboar\nNatural Weapons (Tusks, 1d8 Slashing)\r\nNatural Weapons (Claws, 1d10 Slashing)\r\nGore (1 SP): As part of a successfully damaging attack\r\nwith their tusks, the wereboar can spend a Stamina Point\r\nto immediately deal a bonus SB damage.\nWerebear\nNatural Weapons (Fangs, 1d10 Splitting or Crushing)\r\nNatural Weapons (Claws, 1d12 Slashing or Crushing)\r\nMaul (1 AP + 2 SP): The bear performs a melee attack\r\nas a primary action that deals 2d8 Crushing damage to a\r\ntarget creature within 1 meter. Additionally, all creatures\r\nwithin reach that are Medium or smaller must succeed on\r\nan Acrobatics or Athletics test or be knocked prone.\n123\n\fthere. If they end their turn within the ice, they are crushed\r\nover time, taking 2d8 damage that ignores AR at the end of\r\neach of their turns.\nThe Thirst\r\nVampires must feed on a creature with a black soul at least once\r\nper day. If they go more than a day without feeding, then they\r\ncan no longer gain the benefits of a short or long rest and lose\r\nthe passive benefit from their bloodline until they feed again.\nIn order to feed on a target creature, the target must be restrained,\r\nhelpless, enthralled, or otherwise susceptible to the feeding. The\r\nvampire makes a standard attack against the target with their\r\nFangs, regaining HP equal to the damage dealt after mitigation.\r\nIf a point of damage is successfully dealt to the target in this\r\nway, the targets Endurance Characteristic is reduced by 10 until\r\nafter their next long rest; otherwise, if no damage is successfully\r\ndealt, this does not count as a proper feeding for the day.\nIf the target is helpless or otherwise meets the conditions for a\r\nCoup de Grce, the vampire can spend 2 AP to exsanguinate\r\nthe target completely, killing them in the process and regaining\r\nthe targets remaining HP. After doing so, the vampire loses\r\nany remaining AP. This sates the vampires thirst for two days.\nSanguiphage\r\nVampires sometimes feed on their kin to gain their powers. If\r\na vampire kills another vampire by feeding on them, they gain\r\naccess to the killed vampires bloodline passive ability for the\r\nnext day.\nVampirism\r\nCharacters who complete the transition into Vampirism gain\r\nthe following traits:\r\nSun-Scarred (2)\r\nDawn-Cursed (1)\r\nDark Sight\r\nWeakness (Fire, 2)\r\nResist Normal Weapons (2)\r\nUndead\r\nNatural Weapons (Fangs, 1d6 Splitting, Magic)\r\nDiseased (0, [Strain + Bloodline])\nAdditionally, the characters existing Natural Weapons profile\r\ngains the Slashing Weapon Quality.\nBloodlines\r\nAll vampires are members of a specific bloodline, the most\r\ncommon being the Aundae, the Quarra, the Berne, Cyrodilic\r\nbloodline, and the Volkihar. A vampires bloodline is passed\r\non to the vampires they sire through the transmission of their\r\nvampiric strain.\r\nVampires gain a set of permanent characteristic increases based\r\non their bloodline as defined in the table below:\nBloodline\nStr End\nAg Wp\nPrc\nAundae\nBerne\nCyrodilic\nQuarra\nVolkihar\n+5\n+5\n+5\n+5\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n+10\n+5\n\n\n\n+10\n\n\n\n+5\n+5\n+5\n\n\n\n+10\n\n\n\n\n+5\n+5\n+5\n+5\n+5\nPrs\n+10\n+5\n+5\n\n\n\n+5\nThey also  gain one of the following  passive benefits based on\r\ntheir vampiric bloodline:\nAundae: Arcane Blood\r\nThe character gains the Power Well (10) trait.\nBerne: Unseen, Unheard, Unknown\r\nThe character gains the Chameleon (-10) trait while in dim light,\r\ndarkness, or, at GM discretion,  a crowded area.\nCyrodilic: Mortal Mask\r\nThe character ignores damage from their Dawn-Cursed trait.\r\nAdditionally, while in direct sunlight and not sufficiently covered,\r\ntheir max AP is reduced by 1. Observe or Investigate tests to\r\ndiscern their vampiric nature suffer a -50 penalty.\nQuarra: Vigor of the Grave\r\nThe character gains +1 Max SP.\nVolkihar: Ice Walker\r\nThe character can freely walk through solid ice as if it werent\n124"},"Chapter_6_Magic/Chapter_6_Magic":{"slug":"Chapter_6_Magic/Chapter_6_Magic","filePath":"Chapter_6_Magic/Chapter_6_Magic.md","title":"Chapter_6_Magic","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 6: Magic\nThe Charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are. Your imagination\r\nand your Willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and\r\nafter you cast the Charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse\r\nwhat I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fires reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it,\r\nits hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.\nSotha Sil, 2920, Last Year of the First Era\n\fThere are a number of ways that any given magical effect can be\r\nmanifested. The main four methods of using magic (listed below)\r\nare the focus of this chapter, as they are the most common\r\nmeans of manipulating magicka.\nSpellcasting allows characters to draw on their own \n\nmagicka reserves in order to generate an effect in the\r\nphysical world. Spell casters cast spells using the skill cor-\r\nresponding to the school of magic that the spell is associated\r\nwith. Casters either learn spells or create them from ones\r\nthey already know, though this can be risky.\r\nEnchanting involves using the magicka from souls them-\r\nselves to fuel magic stored within an object. Enchanters\r\ncan use the Enchanting skill to create a number of different\r\nitems with many possible effects.\n  Alchemy uses the magicka trapped within different things \n\nas power to fuel potions with magical effects. Alchemists\r\ncan use the Alchemy skill to create a variety of potions.\r\nRitual Magic is a form of spellcasting that, while it often\r\nrequires extensive preparation, can produce potent effects.\r\nThus Ritual Magic uses the six standard spellcasting Skills,\r\nthough the amount of power involved means that rituals\r\ncan prove quite dangerous if botched.\nRacial and Birthsign powers can be found in Powers in Chapter\r\n2. Other advanced forms of magic exist as well: their rules can\r\nbe found in the Elite Advances section.\nVery few can master it, but all are touched by its presence.\nMagic is the general term used for the focusing of the raw\r\nenergy that flows from Aetherius into Mundus by way of the sun\r\nand stars into various properties and for various purposes. This\r\nenergy is often referred to as magicka. All magical energy comes\r\nfrom Aetherius, and from its magicka Mundus was created.\r\nMagicka comprises every spirit; it is the energy of all living\r\nthings and can be harnessed in a variety of ways. This chapter\r\ncontains rules for magic in its most common forms, as well as\r\nother aspects of the arcane that may be relevant in the course\r\nof the players adventure.\nThe various magic effects are divided into parent Schools of\r\nmagic. Exactly which schools are recognized, and how theyre\r\norganized, varies from era to era in Tamriel, but for the sake\r\nof simplicity this rulebook will utilize the following schools:\n  The school of Alteration revolves around altering the \n\nphysical and magical properties of the world. This can\r\nbe used to augment the self and allies, or hinder enemies.\r\nThe school of Conjuration focuses on calling upon oth-\r\nerworldly entities. These entities can manifest in a number\r\nof different forms.\n  The school of Destruction centers on harming targets in \n\na variety of ways. Either through direct damage or sapping\r\ntheir abilities and defenses.\n  The school of Illusion focuses on affecting light and the \n\nminds of sentient targets. Illusion can be used to manipulate\r\nan enemys perception of reality, or augment ones own.\r\nThe school of Mysticism is a more obscure school, and\r\nits spells manipulate magicka itself. Mysticism can be used\r\nfor many effects, including binding and trapping souls, or\r\nreflecting spells.\n  The school of Restoration revolves around augmenting \n\nand restoring the abilities and body of a target. It also\r\ncontains effects that can be used against the undead.\nThese are not the only schools of magic in the UESRPG either.\r\nCertain supplements contain more obscure or dangerous rules\r\nfor characters wishing to harness unique varieties of magic.\nNote - Schools\r\nThe makeup of the schools of magic have varied drastically\r\nover the eras. The division portrayed here is the one\r\nutilized in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. If playing a\r\ngame in a different era, it is possible to simply regroup\r\nthe spells and effects to reflect the historically correct\r\nschool-division. Alternatively the group can simply leave\r\nthings as they are for convenience.\n126\n\fSpellCaStinG\nSpellcasting is the act of drawing on ones own magicka reserves\r\nin order to generate some sort of effect on the world. Spells can\r\nbe used to create, change, destroy, or manipulate the world and\r\nthe beings within it.\nSpell Components\r\nCasting spells requires a combination of physical components\r\n(typically precise hand motions), verbal components (incan-\r\ntations or words of power), and the mental component of\r\nchanneling ones magicka into the desired effect. Characters\r\ncan combine all three of these components in order to produce\r\na magical effect, which is known as casting a spell.\nSpell Levels\r\nEach spells Spell Level is used to determine how much\r\nmagicka it costs for a character to cast (the specific cost will be\r\nlisted with the spell). Higher level spells produce more powerful\r\neffects. Each level of a spell is its own distinct spell and must\r\nbe learned separately. Some spells have fewer than 7 levels.\nSpell Levels/Names\nSpell Level Name\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNovice\nApprentice\nJourneyman\nAdept\nExpert\nMaster\nGrandmaster\nLearning a spell takes a number of days equal to the level\r\nof the spell and typically requires a character to study from\r\na spell tome or learn from a teacher.\nSpell Schools\r\nEach spell has one or more associated schools of magic. These\r\nreflect the type of effect the spell generates and also determine\r\nwhich skill(s) the character must use in order to cast it.\nSpell Types\r\nIn addition to whatever school it is associated with, spells fall\r\ninto one of two types: Conventional or Unconventional spells.\nConventional Spells are tried and true spells that fall clearly\r\nwithin a single school and produce only a single effect. They are\r\nspells that have been refined over generations by the mages of\r\nTamriel: simple incantations and patterns that produce reliable\r\neffects. In game terms conventional spells are premade spells;\r\nthey exist as a set of  easy premade options to choose from.\nUnconventional Spells are spells that produce more than a\r\nsingle effect, can be classified as belonging to more than one\r\nschool, or are simply a unique variation on a standard effect.\r\nThese spells are considered the realm of over-eager apprentices\r\nand learned masters: experimental magic that can bring great\r\nrisks and great rewards. In game terms unconventional spells\r\nare custom spells; they are how players can tinker with magic.\nSpell Attributes\r\nMany spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify\r\ntheir rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The\r\neffects for these attributes are detailed in the Conventional\r\nSpells section later in this chapter.\nEffect Durations\r\nEffect durations are measured in rounds and end immediately\r\nafter the initiative step on which they took effect. For example,\r\nif an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their turn, they remain\r\nstunned until right after the end of their turn 2 rounds later\r\n(assuming their turn takes place at the same initiative step as\n127\n\fit did originally).\nCasting Spells\r\nIn structured time, characters use the Cast Magic action to cast\r\nspells. Follow these steps to resolve spellcasts:\nStep 1: Caster Declares Spell and Targets\r\nFirst the caster must choose a spell to cast from among those they\r\nknow. If the spell has a target (or targets) other than themself,\r\nthey must choose them now provided they satisfy the spell\r\nconditions (range, etc).\nStep 2: Casting Test\r\nThe caster makes a skill test with the skill corresponding to the\r\nschool of the spell (the Destruction skill for Destruction spells,\r\nand so forth). This test suffers a -10 penalty for each point\r\nby which the spell level exceeds the characters Spellcasting\r\nLevel with that spell. Their Spellcasting Level is determined\r\nby taking the spells school skill level and adding one.  If the\r\ncharacter is untrained in that schools skill, the Spellcasting\r\nLevel in that school is considered zero, and they cannot cast\r\nspells from that school.\nSpell Components\r\nIf the character cannot speak they suffer a -20 penalty to the\r\ncasting test. They suffer an additional -20 penalty to the test if\r\nthey do not have two free hands, either because they are holding\r\nitems or because their movement is restricted in some way.\nStep 3: Resolve the Spell\r\nPass or fail, the caster reduces their magicka by the listed cost of\r\nthe spell. If this would reduce the characters magicka to below\r\nzero, then the spell is not successfully cast.\nIf the caster passed the test, resolve the effects of the spell as\r\nwritten. If the character is casting a multi-part spell, then resolve\neach part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the\r\nparts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).\nAttack Spells\r\nSpells with the attack attribute count as attacks. They are\r\nresolved as appropriate for an attack of that type (either ranged\r\nor melee):\r\nThe casting test for the spell is also the attack test, and the\r\ncasters degrees of success are compared to the defenders.\r\nSpell casting tests can suffer from circumstantial modifiers\r\nthat the GM rules are appropriate.\r\nSpells cannot gain or benefit from advantages.\r\nSpells cannot be parried or countered, only blocked/evaded.\r\nCritical successes cause damaging spells to deal maximum\r\ndamage. Non-damaging spells double their Magicka cost\r\nreduction from Spell Restraint (still subject to the 1 cost\r\nminimum).\r\nSpells cannot benefit from Stamina points.\r\nSpells with the AoE attribute are resolved as AoE attacks.\nSpell Restraint\r\nOn a successful spellcast, a mage can use their will to limit\r\nexcessive use of magicka. This is known as Spell Restraint\r\nor restrained spellcasting. A character can choose to reduce the\r\ncost of a successfully cast spell by their Willpower bonus to a\r\nminimum of 1.\nWhile typically this is desirable, sometimes not holding back\r\nwith a spell can have extra benefits. Some spells have the\r\nOverload attribute, which will state certain extra effects the\r\ncharacter can benefit from if they choose not to restrain the\r\nspell when casting it.\nMagical Backfires\r\nIf a character critically fails when casting a spell, or fails normally\r\nwhen casting either an unconventional spell or any spell with a\r\nspell level above their Spellcasting Level in the corresponding\r\nschool, then they suffer a Magical Backfire. A Magical Backfire is\r\nan uncontrolled, and often harmful, consequence of incorrectly\r\nmanipulating unfamiliar magic. Find the table corresponding\r\nto the backfired spells school in the Magical Mishaps section,\r\nroll a d4, and add the spell level to the result of the roll.\nResolving Opposing Spell Effects\r\nCertain spell effects can be seen as opposing (Enrage and Calm,\r\nfor instance), which can bring some confusion if a target struck\r\nby one is then hit by the other. Resolve all such instances by\r\nsimply assuming that the newer spell effect overrides the old one.\n128\n\fConventional SpellS\nConventional spells are tried and true spells that fall clearly\r\nwithin a single school and produce only a single effect. They are\r\nspells that have been refined over generations by the mages of\r\nTamriel: simple, elegant incantations and patterns that produce\r\nreliable effects. This section contains rules for using conventional\r\nspells and a full list of them.\nSpell Profiles\r\nEach conventional spell profile listed here includes the follow-\r\ning: the name of the spell, its school, its spell level(s)/strength,\r\ncorresponding magicka costs, spell attributes, and rules for\r\nresolving the spell. The Spell Strength of a spell is simply a\r\nvariable that is used to quantify the strength of the spell in its\r\nrules entry, and that is based on the spell level.\nSpell Levels/Names\nSpell Level\nName\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNovice\nApprentice\nJourneyman\nAdept\nExpert\nMaster\nGrandmaster\nUnless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack with\r\nthemselves.\nSpell Attributes\r\nMany spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify\r\ntheir rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The rules\r\nfor spell attributes apply to all types of spells but are included\r\nin this section for convenience:\nAttack: Using this effect is considered an Attack for the\npurposes of determining Attacks per round.\nInstant: This spell can be cast using a Secondary Action,\r\npermitting the caster to either cast the spell on their turn\r\nor as a Reaction outside of their turn.\nUpkeep: The caster can, as a free action, refresh the\r\neffect (including any required tests or rolls, not includ-\r\ning the casting test, using the original target(s)) and\r\nduration  of  this  spell  when  it  ends  by  paying  the\r\noriginal cost that they paid for the spell as long as the\r\nrequirements  for  the  spell  (like  range)  are  still  met.\nthe spell if they have cast a different spell since the original\r\ncast. If a spell has the Attack attribute, then upkeeping the\r\nspell counts toward the maximum attacks per round limit.\r\nOverload: The caster benefits from an extra effect (as spec-\r\nified) if not restraining this spell.\r\nReinforce: By default, spells with the Reinforce attribute\r\nhave no extra effects. When a character takes the Mage\r\nGuard and the Arcane Defender talents, they benefit from\r\na bonus to the spell effect if not restraining the spell.\r\nRanged (range): Spell can affect a target within the listed\r\nrange.\r\nMelee (range): Spell counts as melee with the listed range.\r\nDoes not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n  AoE (range, form): This spell counts as a ranged, area of \n\neffect of the given form/radius. Pulse form AoEs affect\r\nthe caster.\r\nDirect: This spell has a target or targets but is not an attack\r\nand cannot be defended against by normal means.\r\nMindlock (X): Reduces the casters max AP by X to a\r\nminimum of zero.\r\n[Variation]: This spell has multiple variations, each cor-\r\nresponding to one of the listed items.

Traps\r\na beings soul energy on death into a naturally-occurring soul gem.\r\nUpkeep, Direct\r\n2\r\nLevel:\nCost:\n 16\n\nTarget character within 50m has their soul magically tethered\r\nto an appropriate empty soul gem (only black soul gems can\r\nhold the souls of men, mer, and the beast races) of the casters\r\nchoice within 1m of their person. If the target dies within\r\n1 minute, then their soul is trapped within the gem, and it\r\ngains soul energy equal to the size of their soul. If this spell is\r\naffected by a Reflect spell or effect, then the casters own soul\r\nis trapped within the chosen soul gem. Soul Trap is seen as a\r\nhostile action when cast on an unwilling target, but it is not\r\nconsidered an Attack.\nTelekinesis\r\nMany a supposed poltergeist hauntings are actually nothing more\r\nthan a bored apprentice practicing their telekinesis spell on the\r\nunwitting locals.\r\nUpkeep, Instant\r\n1\r\nLevel:\n 7\r\n\r\n 5\r\n\r\n 6\r\n\r\n 3\r\n\r\n 4\r\n\r\n 2\n\nCost:\n 4\n\n[Spell Str.]\n1\n7\n2\n10\n3\n13\n4\n16\n5\n19\n6\n22\n7\nThe caster gains the Telekinesis ([Spell Strength]) trait for 1\r\nminute.\nSunder Binding\r\nThe caster focus their will and attempts to sunder the binding of\r\na conjured creature within sight.\r\nDirect, Sunder Binding is also a Conjuration spell\nLevel:\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n7\n\nCost:\n5\n6\n[Spell Str.]\n+20\n+10\n7\n0\n8\n-10\n9\n-20\n10\n-30\n11\n-40\nThe caster of this spell picks a target within 50m that has the\r\nSummoned trait.

Necromancy is fuelled\r\nby black magicks and feeds on the living, and serves as an\r\nenticing shortcut to power for the less scrupulous mages that\r\nroam Tamriel.\nReanimation\r\nA common spell amongst Necromancers, Reanimation spells allow\r\na Necromancer to temporarily imbue a corpse with false life to\r\nserve them.\r\nUpkeep, Direct, Mindlock (1)\r\n1\nLevel:\n 7\r\n\r\n 5\r\n\r\n 6\r\n\r\n 3\r\n\r\n 4\r\n\r\n 2\n\nCost:\n14\r\n[Spell Str.] Puny Tiny\n9\n19\n24\n29\n34\n39\nSmall\nStd.\nLrg.

It also contains effects\r\nthat can be used specifically against the Undead.\nTarget corpse of [Spell Strength] size is reanimated for one\r\nminute, using the profile it had in life. The target must imme-\r\ndiately test an Opposed Willpower with the caster. If the caster\r\nwins the test, the target also has the Bound trait. If the target\r\nwins the test, they are reanimated but are not Bound to the caster.\nCure Disease\r\nDisease can be a taxing event while adventuring. Stop disease in\r\nits tracks and continue on wherever you go.\r\nInstant\nThe target is reanimated with full HP, Stamina Points, Action\r\nPoints, Magicka, and any uses of limited use abilities.\nThe spell imbues the body with the spirit of a lesser daedra,\r\nand has no shred of the characters consciousness, soul, or any\r\nknowledge of their past life except for skills, talents, traits, and\r\nspells.

There\r\nis no list of them, it is the catch all term for the unique\r\nspells that can be created from the various magical effects\r\nand forms that exist within the system. This section contains\r\nrules for creating and using your own unconventional spells.\nImportant Note\r\nThe creation and use of Unconventional Spells provides\r\ncasters with a powerful system to customize their spell\r\narsenal and is integral to the classic Elder Scrolls expe-\r\nrience. This system was designed with flexibility and\r\ncustomization as priorities, which leaves it vulnerable to\r\nthe creation of over-powered spells and spell effect combi-\r\nnations. Players should always review Unconventional\r\nSpells with their GM before they are implemented in\r\nplay.\nCreating a Spell\r\nCreating an unconventional spell is a matter of putting pieces\r\ntogether to make a functioning spell that can be used like any\r\nof the premade conventional spells.\nThe Basics\r\nThe two pieces that players can combine to create spells are\r\ncalled effects and forms.\nAn Effect is the actual content of a spell: the fire effect causes\r\nfire damage while the heal effect heals it. A Form is the shape\r\nof the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fireball,\r\nwhich uses the ball form) while others are cast only on the\r\ncaster themself (the self  form).\nCreating a spell is a matter of combining effects and forms\r\nthat are allowed to fit together, setting the parameters of each,\r\nand then writing down the combined result so that you can\r\nreference it during gameplay.\nMulti Part Spells\r\nUnconventional spells can also be multi-part spells, which simply\r\nmeans that they contain multiple spells in a single spell. For\r\nexample a character might create a spell that when cast allows\r\nthem to both jump further and walk on water, which are two\r\nseparate effects. These distinct parts are referred to as Spell Parts,\r\nwhile the spell containing them is referred to as the Parent Spell.\nWhen a character is casting a multi-part spell, they should resolve\r\neach part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the\r\nparts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).\nLearning Effects &amp; Forms\r\nA character can use any form when creating an unconventional\r\nspell, but may only utilize effects from schools of magic in which\r\nthey are trained (meaning the skill is novice rank or higher).\r\nSpell Attributes\r\nSpell attributes are tags that modify the rules of a spell or clarify\r\nhow they function in game terms. Effects and forms each have\r\nspell attributes associated with them that are combined when\r\nthe complete spell profile is created.\nReference Materials\r\nA complete list of effects, forms, and spell attributes can be\r\nfound in the Spell Making Reference in the"},"Chapter_7_Economics_-and-_Equipment/Chapter_7_Economics_-and-_Equipment":{"slug":"Chapter_7_Economics_-and-_Equipment/Chapter_7_Economics_-and-_Equipment","filePath":"Chapter_7_Economics_&_Equipment/Chapter_7_Economics_&_Equipment.md","title":"Chapter_7_Economics_&_Equipment","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 7: Economics &amp; Equipment\nSo many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. Its a very sad state of affairs,\r\nwhen the game is really open to all, you dont need an invitation. And it is a game, the game of bargaining, to be\r\nplayed seriously and, I hasten to add, politely.\nThe Buying Game\n\fIn a normal day, a plethora of goods flows through Tamriels\nmarkets. Tamriels many thriving economies have resulted in a\r\ncontinent linked through trade and commerce. There are a vast\r\nnumber of goods and services produced by these systems that\r\ncharacters might need to survive, or might encounter, during\r\ntheir adventures. This chapter is concerned with the economics\r\nof the Elder Scrolls setting, as well as detailing the various items\r\nplayers use or buy.\nCurrency\r\nThe main currency of Tamriel in the time during and after the\r\nSeptim Empire is the Septim, a golden coin around the size\r\nof a quarter. Named after the dynasty that ruled the Septim\r\nEmpire, it features a bust of Tiber Septim and a depiction of\r\nAkatosh. The inscription on the front reads, The Empire is Law.\r\nThe Law is Sacred. And the reverse reads:, Praise be, Akatosh\r\nand all the Divines. Although many provinces issue their own\r\nprovincial currencies these can all be converted to Septims. If\r\nyou are running a campaign in an era before the Septim Empire,\r\nsimply use an alternative name (such as Remans). And while\r\nwe have no information on the way that the Empire handles\r\nits monetary policy, the authors are making the assumption\r\nthat there are different types or denominations of currency in\r\nexistence within the empire. In game terms, this means a few\r\nthings:\n         This Chapter will use the more Era-neutral word Drakes \n\nfor currency. Gold is an acceptable substitute, though\r\nthe authors would prefer not to assume that every coin\r\nactually contains gold.\r\nCoins have no in-game weight unless the GM decides a\r\ncharacter is simply carrying too much money to ignore.\r\nThis is done for simplicity.\r\nRather than making players keep track of the different kinds\r\nof coins they have, it should be assumed that characters\r\ncan carry as much money as they want, simply making use\r\nof more and more valuable denominations.\r\nLikewise, it should be assumed that there are enough coins\r\nof the various denominations floating around that indi-\r\nviduals can always complete transactions accurately and\r\nreceive change.\nIn short, dont worry about how many of which types of coins\r\nyoure carrying. Just keep track of how many Drakes you have.\r\nThis is to save time and accounting for both the players and\r\nthe GM.\nFor groups that enjoy this sort of thing, it is easy to convert the\r\nsystem into one based around different types of coins. Simply\r\nuse the value of a single Drake as the base for the lowest value\r\ncoin and scale things up by multiples of ten for more valuable\r\ncoins as you see fit.\npriCinG &amp; aCquiSition\nNot all prices for one item are going to be the same: regional\r\nprice variations are to be expected. Some things are simply\r\nharder to get a hold of in some places and easier in others.\r\nAdditionally, item price will vary drastically with the quality of\r\nthe item itself. We have intentionally left item rarity up to\r\nthe Game Master for the majority of items in this section.\r\nThese guidelines should help the GM produce prices that are\r\nacceptable for game-play purposes.\nA Note on Rounding\r\nIf an item ever ends up with a fractional price for any reason,\r\nsimply round up to the nearest whole number.\nAvailability &amp; Cost Modifiers\r\nIn order to locate an item for sale, a character must make a\r\nCommerce or Investigate test. The difficulty of the test should\r\nbe determined by the specific item the character is looking for.\r\nThe GM should use their judgment and lore knowledge in equal\r\nmeasure when making their decision. The following table can\r\nprovide some guidelines:\nAvailability Modifiers\nItem Availability Modifier\nExtremely Rare\nRare\nScarce\nUncommon\nAverage\nOrdinary\nCommon\nPlentiful\nUbiquitous\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n\n\n\n+10\n+20\n+30\n+40\nItem Quality Level\r\nItems can also vary drastically in quality based on how well\r\nthey were made or some feature inherent to the item. This\r\nwill modify their price and their availability. There are three\r\nquality levels for most items: inferior, common, and superior.\r\nExactly what measurable impact this has on the item (if any)\r\nwill be explained in the appropriate section (Weapon Quality\r\nand Armor and Shield Quality sections later in this chapter).\r\nItem Quality Level\nQuality\nInferior\nAvailability\n2 steps more common\nCommon\nNo change\nSuperior\n2 steps rarer\nPrice\n-50%\n\n\n\n+100%\n169\n\fbefore going for the bargain, roll a Commerce Test with a mod-\r\nifier equal to the items rarity (see Availability Modifiers on page\r\n108) to see if they can learn the current rates.\r\nOn a success, the character gains a +10 bonus to their attempt\r\nat haggling.\r\nOn a failure however, add a -5 penalty per Degree of Failure\r\nto their attempt at haggling, as they have misinterpreted the\r\ncurrent trend of the market.\nLocation Modifiers\r\nWhile Tamriel has a flourishing international market due to the\r\nmany merchant guilds dotting the continent, certain objects\r\nmust be imported or accessed through more illegitimate means.\r\nThe following table can provides some guidelines for any such\r\navailability and pricing modifiers:\nCircumstance\nAvailability Mod\nIllegal ware\nStolen goods\nLocal wares (Chitin in\r\nMorrowind)\nImported from nearby\r\nregion (Adaman-\r\ntium outside High\r\nRock)\nRare/limited import\r\n(Dwemer artifacts,\r\nDragon remains.)\nIncreased 1 step\nIncreased 2 steps\nDecreased 1 step\nPrice\n+25%\n-20%\nN/A\nIncreased 1 step\n+25%\nIncreased 2 steps\n+50%\nHaggling for a Bargain\r\nBargaining is a part of everyday life and almost expected amongst\r\nprofessional merchants.\r\nShould a character wish to bargain with a merchant for the\r\nprice of their wares, roll an opposed Commerce Test against\r\nthe merchant.\r\nFor every Degree of Success the character scores above the\r\nmerchant, a 5% discount is gained.\r\nIf the merchant wins the Commerce test, increase the price by\r\n5% per Degree of Success instead.\r\nA character can always choose to not accept a bad bargain, but\r\na local market is a living, breathing thing and word travels fast\r\nabout bad customers.\r\nShould a character deny a bargain and go elsewhere, the GM\r\ncan choose to apply a penalty equal to the % of the bargain\r\nthat was denied.\nUnscrupulous Traders\r\nCertain merchants can be particularly unscrupulous in their\r\nbargaining, either due to holding a monopoly on a certain\r\nware or being a position that allows them to press their hapless\r\nvictim for an extra fee like a fence giving less for stolen goods,\r\nwell knowing that the prospective seller has nowhere else to go.\r\nWhen bargaining with such unscrupulous types, the GM can\r\nchoose to apply a penalty ranging from -10 to -40 to the char-\r\nacters Commerce Test when bargaining for a better price on\r\ntheir goods.\nAppraising an Item\r\nNot knowing the current market value of certain goods has\r\nbeen the bane of many a haggler.\r\nIf a character wishes to assert the price of an object of interest\n170\n\fweaponS\nConflict and danger are constants in Tamriel, and it is wise\r\nfor adventurers to arm themselves. Weapons in UESRPG are\r\ndivided in a number of different ways. First, there are two classes\r\nof weapons: melee and ranged. All weapons are defined by a\r\nWeapon Profile, which contains all the information necessary\r\nto use the weapon.\nWeapon Qualities\r\nMany weapons possess special rules, known as Weapon\r\nQualities, that represent factors that set them apart from other\r\nweapons in some fashion.\nThe Big Three\r\nBelow are the three most important weapon qualities. Most\r\nweapons posses one of these qualities, which are critical to their\r\nidentity. Their effects can stack on instances of themselves or\r\nwith one another.\nCrushing (X)\r\nWeapons with this quality can crush metal and bone alike. They\r\ndeal bonus damage equal to the wielders Strength bonus (or X,\r\nif another value is given), capped at the AR of the hit location\r\nor BR of a shield used to block it.\nSplitting (X)\r\nWeapons with this quality can deal savage wounds when properly\r\nbrought to bear. They deal bonus damage equal to the wielders\r\nStrength bonus (or X, if another value is given), but only if the\r\ninitial damage result causes the target to lose 1 or more HP.\nSlashing (X)\r\nWeapons with this quality tear flesh with ease, dealing extra\r\ndamage equal to the wielders Strength bonus (or X, if another\r\nvalue is given) against unarmored hit locations.\nOther Weapon Qualities\r\nListed below are many of the other qualities weapons may have.\r\nIt is important to be familiar with the qualities your weapons\r\npossess and how they interact with one another!\nComplex\r\nA character cannot move on a turn that they are reloading this\r\nweapon.\nConcussive\r\nThe weapon causes heavy impacts and can send opponents\r\nsprawling. When a character triggers the bash special action\r\nafter gaining advantage with this weapon, they gain a +20 bonus\r\nto the opposed test.\nDamaged (X)\r\nWeapons with this quality deal X less damage. If this would\r\never render a character incapable of dealing damage with the\r\nweapon, even with the maximum possible roll, then the weapon\r\nis destroyed. Natural Weapons cannot receive this Quality. All\r\ninstances of this quality stack.\nDueling Weapon\r\nWeapons with this quality add an additional degree of success\r\nto successful tests made to parry or Counter-Attack with them.\nEntangling\r\nAttacks with this weapon cannot be parried or blocked. Instead\r\nof dealing damage, a successful attack with this weapon forces\r\nthe opponent to make a Strength or Agility test. If they fail, they\r\ngain the Entangled (page 111) condition. They can spend 1\r\nAP as a Secondary Action to repeat the test, freeing themselves\r\nand removing the condition on a success.\nIf this effect was applied by a melee attack, then should the\r\ntarget character leave the melee range of the Entangling weapon,\r\nthe character wielding the weapon must choose to either let go\r\nof their weapon (maintaining the effect on the target) or keep\r\ntheir weapon (removing the effect from the target).\nFocus\r\nCharacter treats the hand holding the weapon as a free hand\r\nfor the purposes of casting spells. The weapon does not increase\r\nthe range of any spell as a result of its reach.\nExploit Weakness\r\nThese weapons are small and able to slip into gaps in a targets\r\ndefenses. Attacks with this weapon treat full armor as partial\r\narmor and partial armor as unarmored (but do not actually\r\nreduce the locations AR). This can be used to trigger effects,\r\nsuch as Slashing, that interact with the level of armor the target\r\nis wearing.\nFlail\r\nWeapons of this type are able to strike unpredictably. These\r\nweapons cannot be parried or countered, but cannot be used to\r\nparry or Counter-Attack either. If an attacker with this weapon\r\nand a defender blocking with a shield both pass their respective\r\ntests and the attackers degrees of success exceed those of the\r\ndefender, then the defender does not block the attack as they\r\nnormally would, and the attack is resolved as if the attacker\r\nhad won. If a character critically fails an attack with a flail they\r\nhit themselves.\n171\n\fImpaling\r\nIf this weapon is used to make an attack of opportunity\r\nagainst a character who is approaching the wielder, and\r\nthat attack causes the target to lose HP, the target does not\r\nadvance and instead halts their movement for the turn.\nHand to Hand\r\nThis weapon can be used with Unarmed Combat Style and\r\ncounts as Unarmed for the purposes of resolving damage.\r\nAdditionally, the wielder can perform actions that require an\r\nopen hand while wielding these weapons at a -10 penalty.\nHooked\r\nThis weapon has a hook that can be used to trip and yank\r\nopponents and their weapons. Attempts to defend against the\r\ncharacters Disarm, Take Weapon &amp; Trip Special Actions is\r\ndone at a -10 penalty.\nMagic\r\nWeapons with this quality are able to harm targets that would\r\notherwise resist or be impervious to damage from normal weap-\r\nons, such as ghosts.\nMounted\r\nWeapons with this quality can only be used while mounted due\r\nto their weight and balance and only if the character moves.\nPrimitive\r\nRoll twice and use the lower value for this weapons damage.\nProven\r\nRoll twice and use the higher value for this weapons damage.\nReload (X)\r\nAfter attacking with this weapon, characters must spend X AP\r\nusing a Ready Secondary Action in order to reload this weapon\r\nbefore they can attack with it again.\nShield Splitter\r\nAttacks from this weapon halve the BR of shields used to block\r\nthem (round up).\nSling\r\nThis weapon does not use conventional ammunition; instead,\r\nit uses small rocks and other similarly-sized and shaped objects.\r\nAmmunition can be specifically purchased or crafted for this\r\nweapon but the materials damage bonus is not applied.\nSmall\r\nThis weapon cannot be used to Parry or Counter attacks from 2\r\nhanded weapons. Readying it does not cost an AP. The wielder\r\nmay make a Subterfuge skill test to conceal the weapon. Enemies\nwith normal weapons can make opportunity attacks against\r\ncharacters with this weapon who enter their range.\nSnare\r\nThis weapon can be used to perform the Bash and Trip Special\r\nActions while ignoring the 2 meter range limitation. Doing\r\nso always uses the attackers Combat Style skill against the\r\ndefenders Athletics or Evade skill.\nThrown (X/Y/Z)\r\nThis weapon can be thrown as a ranged attack against a target\nwithin X/Y/Z meters. Resolve this like a normal ranged attack\r\n(though Strength can be a base for the test), dealing the weapons\r\nnormal damage and ignoring Slashing/Crushing/Splitting.\nUnwieldy\r\nAttempts to parry or Counter-Attack using this weapon suffer\r\na -20 penalty.\nRanged &amp; Melee Weapons\nWeapon Attributes\r\nAll weapons have most of these attributes associated with them:\r\nDamage (Dam): The damage dealt by the weapon. Typically\r\nexpressed as a die roll to which a value may be added.\r\nHandedness: How many hands the weapon requires.\n     One Handed: Weapon can be wielded in one hand. \r\nHand and a Half: Weapon may be used with one or \n\ntwo hands (cannot be dual wielded). When using it in\r\ntwo hands, use the larger damage value (in parenthesis).\n     Two Handed: Weapon requires the use of two hands.\r\n     Reach: A melee weapons range in meters. Represents effec-\n\ntive threat range and not merely the length of the weapon.\r\nWeapons with a minimum range (such as 2-3m) cannot\r\nattack targets below their minimum range.\r\nRange: A ranged weapons short, medium, and long ranges.\r\nAttacking targets in close range provides a +10 bonus\r\nto attack tests with the weapon, while attacking targets\r\nat long range imposes a -20 penalty.\r\nENC: The weapons Encumbrance value.\r\nQualities: Any Weapon Qualities the weapon has.\r\nPrice: The base price of the weapon in Drakes.\nWeapon Materials\r\nEvery weapon is made of something, and the material of a\r\nweapon can dramatically improve its effectiveness. When pick-\r\ning a weapon from either the ranged or melee weapon tables,\r\nyou must pick a material for that weapon as well from the\r\nappropriate table below.\nA weapons material determines…\n   Enchant  Level:  The  maximum  soul  energy  of  any \n\n172\n\f\nenchantment that can be placed on the weapon.\r\nPrice Modifier: Modifies the base price of the weapon to\r\ndetermine the final cost (quality modifies this value).\r\nAny modifiers to damage or range the weapon receives.\nAny additional qualities the weapon has.\nWeapon Quality Level\r\nThe overall quality with which a weapon is crafted can have a\r\ndramatic impact on how effective it is in combat.

Often only provided by skilled craftsmen.\nSpell Focus (100 drakes): Gains Focus.\n\nThrown Ranged Weapons\r\nRanged weapons with the Thrown quality count as melee weap-\r\nons for the purposes of determining weapon material.\nAmmunition\r\nMost ranged weapons use ammunition to reload: either arrows\r\n(bows) or bolts (crossbows). The material of the ammunition\r\nmodifies the damage of the weapon on the shot its used for.\r\nThe material of the ammunition can also impart certain quali-\r\nties to the attack and determines the enchantment level of the\r\nammunition. Ammunition is priced per 10 shots, and each shot\r\nis ENC 0 (so 10 shots is ENC 1).\nBolts have no unique rules associated with them, and their\r\nrules are built into the profile of the crossbows above. Arrows,\r\non the other hand, come in one of two different types, each\r\ncorresponding with the way that type inflicts damage. There\r\nare no cost differences between these types:\nArrow Types\nSlashing Arrows: The shot gains the Slashing quality (uses\nthe firing characters Strength bonus as normal).\nSplitting Arrows: The shot gains the Splitting quality (uses\nthe firing characters Strength bonus as normal).\n176\n\farMor\n(Crippling)\r\nCharacter cannot move, and suffers a -40 to all tests.\nThere are many styles and types of armor that the people of\r\nTamriel use to defend themselves. This section provides rules\r\nfor the use of both worn armor and shields.\nWorn Armor\r\nWorn armor encompasses anything that a character wears to\r\nprotect their body from harm.\nArmor Qualities\r\nMany armor pieces and shields possess special rules, known\r\nas Armor Qualities, that represent specific effects or certain\r\ndifferences between armor types.\nMagic\r\nArmor with this quality is magical and provides protection\r\nagainst certain attacks, such as those of incorporeal beings.\r\nShields with this quality can be used to block such attacks.\nDamaged (X)\r\nA piece of Armor or a shield with this quality has its all of its\r\nArmor Ratings (AR, MR, etc) or BR reduced by X. If this would\r\nreduce AR or BR to 0, then the item is destroyed. Natural Armor\r\ncannot receive this Quality. All instances of this quality stack.\nWeight Classes\r\nMost armors and shields have a weight class, reflected by one\r\nof the qualities below, that represents how heavy and restrictive\r\nthat armor is. When wearing multiple different types of armor\r\nand/or carrying a shield, the character always uses the effects\r\nof their heaviest armor piece.\n(No listed class)\r\nThe armor is light enough it imposes no penalties on its user.\nLight\r\nLight armor imposes a minor penalty on a characters mobility:\r\nThe character suffers a -10 penalty to Acrobatics skill tests.\nMedium\r\nMedium armor imposes a moderate penalty on a characters\r\nmobility: the character suffers a -10 penalty to Agility based tests\r\n(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 1.\nHeavy\r\nHeavy armor imposes a substantial penalty on a characters\r\nmobility: the character suffers a -20 penalty to Agility based tests\r\n(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 2.\nSuper-Heavy\r\nSuper-Heavy armor imposes a staggering penalty on a characters\r\nmobility: the character suffers a -30 penalty to Agility based tests\r\n(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 3.\nArmor Rating &amp; Hit Locations\r\nA given piece of armor protects a single hit location on a charac-\r\nters body. The standard uniform of the Imperial Legionaire, for\r\nexample, is a steel breastplate (body), helmet (head),  pauldrons/\r\nbracers (arms), and greaves/boots (legs).\nA piece of armors Armor Rating (AR) is a measure of how\r\nmuch protection it offers to that hit location: any physical\r\nattacks that strike that hit location have their damage\r\nreduced by its AR. Some armors also have additional AR values\r\nthat protect against other damage types (such as magic AR).\nArmor Classes\r\nInstead of trying to keep track of the myriad styles of armor\r\nthat exist, all armor in the UESRPG is divided into one of two\r\nclasses: partial and full armor.\nPartial Armor is any piece of armor that does not entirely\r\ncover the hit location it is protecting. As a result it typically\r\noffers lower protection than full armor but weighs much less.\nFull Armor is any piece of armor that almost entirely covers\r\nthe hit location it is protecting. As a result it typically offers\r\nimproved protection at the cost of increased weight.\nThe combination of an armors class and material are what make\r\nup its complete profile. It is these combinations that characters\r\nchoose from when picking armor.

The\r\nfollowing table details what each quality level does to the profile.\nArmor/Shield Quality\nItem Quality Profile Changes\nInferior\nIncreases weight class by one step.\nCommon\nNo change\nPrice\n-25%\n\n\n\nSuperior\nDecreases weight class by one step.\n+100%\nSpecial Armor Qualities\r\nCertain extra qualities that can be used to enhance existing\r\narmor. Often only provided by skilled craftsmen.\nRuned (+25% price): Gains Magic and 1 magic AR.\nShields\r\nShields are defensive weapons used to protect their wielders\r\nfrom enemy attack. They are considered a type of armor in this\r\nsystem but do not follow the normal rules for armor.\nBlock Rating\r\nInstead of an AR, shields have a Block Rating (BR), which\r\nreflects a combination of the shields coverage and toughness.\r\nIf a character blocks an attack with a shield, then the attacker\r\nrolls damage with the attacking weapon. If the damage result\r\nis less than or equal to the shields BR, nothing happens. If\r\nthe damage result exceeds the shields BR, then the character\r\ntakes that damage on their shield arm. Shields count their\r\nBR as being half as much (round up) against attacks that\r\ndeal magic damage unless they have a unique BR listed for\r\nmagical attacks.\nThis reflects the way that, while a shield can protect its user\r\nfrom harm,  using a shield to block repeated heavy hits can\r\nquickly drain a defenders energy even if they are still able to\r\navoid direct harm. Eventually they will find themselves tiring\r\nand unable to maintain their defense.\nShields\nQualities\nENC Enchant Lvl\nPrice\nType\nBR\nHide Shield\nChitin Shield\nLeather Shield\nFur Shield\nNetch Leather Shield\nBonemold Shield\nIron Shield\nMoonstone Shield\nDreugh Shield\nSteel Shield\nDwemer Shield\nMithril Shield\nOrichalcum Shield\nAdamantium Shield\nMalachite Shield\nDragonscale Shield\nEbony Shield\nDaedric Shield\nStalhrim Shield\nDragonbone Shield\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n8\n9\n9\n10\n10\n10\n10\n11\n11\n11\n11\n12\n12\n12\n13\nMagic BR\n(1/2 value base)\n(3) 4 vs frost\n(4) 5 vs fire\n(4) 5 vs fire\n(4) 5 vs frost\n(4) 5 vs shock\n(4)\n(5)\n6\n6\n(5)\n6\n6\n(6)\n8\n8\n11\n9\n12\nLight\n\n\n\nLight\nLight\nLight\nLight\nMedium\nLight, Magic\r\nMedium, Magic\r\nMedium\nMedium, Magic\r\nMagic\r\nMedium\nMedium\nMagic\r\nMedium, Magic\r\nHeavy, Magic\r\nHeavy, Magic\n(6) 12 vs frost Medium, Magic\n13\nHeavy, Magic\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n1\n3\n4\n4\n3\n4\n50\n200\n150\n100\n200\n300\n200\n500\n300\n300\n800\n900\n400\n1000\n200\n1250\n1250\n1500\n1000\n1500\n40\n70\n60\n50\n70\n120\n120\n200\n220\n170\n330\n650\n240\n1100\n1700\n7000\n3500\n6500\n4500\n12000\n180\n\fShield Types\nTower Shield\r\nAll shields can be purchased as a tower shield instead. Tower\r\nshields are 1 weight class heavier (to a maximum of super-heavy)\r\nthan a normal shield of their type, have 1 higher ENC, and cost\r\n25% more. Tower shields grant the wielder a +10 bonus to tests\r\nmade to block attacks, but carrying one reduces a characters\r\nSpeed by 1.\nTarge\r\nAll shields can be purchased as a targe instead. Targes are 1\r\nweight class lower than normal shields of their type and cost 25%\r\nless. Targes halve their BR (rounding up) and count as a free\r\nhand, but only for wielding Small weapons or when grappling.\nBuckler\r\nAll shields can be purchased as a buckler instead. Bucklers are\r\n1 weight class lower than a normal shield of their type, have 1\r\nlower ENC, and cost 25% less. Bucklers can not block. Instead,\r\nthey add an extra degree of success to all successful Parry tests.\r\nAdditionally, when the defender wins an opposed Parry test\r\nthey always gain Advantage, but they must pay the AP cost if\r\npicking the Special Action Advantage.\nThink of melee as a mirror. I look to my opponents left arm\r\nwhen I am striking with my right. If he is prepared to block\r\nmy blow, I blow not. Why exert undue force? Mindothrax\r\ncocked an eyebrow, But when I see his right arm tense, my\r\nleft arm goes to my shield. You see, it takes twice as much\r\npower to send force than it does to deflect it. When your eye\r\ncan recognize whether your opponent is striking from above,\r\nor at angle, or in an uppercut from below, you learn to pivot\r\nand place your shield just so to protect yourself. I could block\r\nfor hours if need be, but it only takes a few minutes, or even\r\nseconds, for your opponent, used to battering, to leave a space\r\nopen for your own strike.\n\nThe Mirror, by Berdier Wreans\n\n181\n\fGoodS &amp; ServiCeS\nThis section contains prices for all the common, everyday things\r\nthat characters need to survive, the luxuries that separate the\r\nrich from the poor, and all the various properties and services\r\nthat adventurers might need on their journey.\nLifestyle Expenses\r\nLifestyle expenses are a simple, average number players can\r\nuse to track their spending during downtime and reflect the\r\naverage amount a character spends on a daily basis to maintain\r\na lifestyle of a certain comfort level.

If the character\r\nis providing either the soul gem, the base item, or both, then\r\nignore that portion of the cost. The fee the enchanter charges\r\nshould be based on the total spell level of the enchantment. The\r\ntable below provides a guideline for the GMs use:\nEnchanter Fee\nSpell Level\nCost\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n100\n250\n500\n1000\n2500\n5000\n7+\n10000\nAll of these prices assume a Binding Strength of 3 for the purposes\r\nof cast enchantments. Higher/lower binding strengths require\r\nmore/less skilled enchanters, which increase/decrease the total price\r\nby 20% for each step (max 5).\nSpell Scrolls\r\nSpell scrolls are single use items that have had a particular spell\r\nbound to them through the use of enchanting. By reading the\r\nmagical inscription on the scroll the character can invoke the\r\nstored magic without the difficulty of casting it themselves.\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level\nCost\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7+\n30\n45\n90\n150\n300\n600\n1500\n185\n\fAll of these prices assume a Binding Strength of 3. Higher/lower\r\nbinding strengths require more/less skilled enchanters, which\r\nincrease/decrease the total price by 20% for each step (max 5).\nSpell Tomes &amp; Training\r\nSpell tomes are one of the ways that characters can learn conven-\r\ntional spells. Spell tomes are books (despite their name, they can\r\nbe fairly small) that contain the knowledge necessary to use a\r\ngiven spell. They not only contain practical instructions for using\r\nthe spell, but a history of the evolution of the spell, alternative\r\nforms of casting, mnemonic devices, and other information that\r\ncan help a character attain a full understanding of the magic\r\nthey are learning to use.\nLearning a spell from a tome takes a number of days equal to\r\nthe spell level. This time must be spent in practice and study.\nSpell Tomes\nSpell Level\nCost\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7+\n25\n50\n100\n250\n500\n1000\n5000\nAlternatively, a character can be taught a spell. This takes one\r\nless day (to a minimum of 1 hour) than it would take to learn\r\nthe spell from a tome but also requires a teacher. Use the costs\r\nabove as the training cost.\nAlchemical Ingredients\r\nPotions are created using alchemical ingredients. Higher quality\r\ningredients have higher strength, allowing for more powerful\r\neffects. The following table lists the various quality levels and\r\ncosts of alchemical ingredients of any given type and their cor-\r\nresponding strength and depth values:\nAlchemical Ingredients (any school)\nType\nStrength\nDepth\nPrice\nUbiquitous\nPlentiful\nCommon\nUncommon\nRare\nVery Rare\nExtremely Rare\nLegendary\n2\n5\n10\n15\n25\n50\n100\n200\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n1\n5\n10\n35\n100\n250\n500\n1000\nAlchemist Services\r\nPotions can be quite useful when employed correctly. Characters\r\ncan hire alchemists to create potions or poisons with effects of\r\nall types. Their cost is determined by the following formula:\nPotion/Poison Price: Ingredient + Fee\r\nDetermine the effects of the created potion using the normal\r\npotion or poison creation rules found in the Alchemy section.\r\nThe formula above assumes the character is paying for the ingre-\r\ndient and the alchemy service. If the character is providing the\r\ningredients, then ignore that portion of the cost. The fee the\r\nalchemist charges should be based on the total spell level of the\r\npotion.

This section contains rules for characters wishing to create\r\nitems of all types.|\nStep 1: Determine Item\r\nFirst, the character must choose the item they wish to create.\r\nSome items cannot be created, such as those that only occur\r\nnaturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining\r\nif a character can craft an item. The character must also choose\r\nthe quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined\r\nwith the items base price will allow them to determine the\r\napproximate market value of the item.\nStep 2: Gather Raw Materials\r\nNext the character must gather the raw materials necessary to\r\ncreate the item. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to\r\nitem, but as a general rule of thumb if the character wishes\r\nto purchase all the raw materials it will cost roughly one\r\nthird of the items standard price.\nStep 3: Determine Test Difficulty\r\nThird the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test.\r\nThe difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely\r\non the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees\r\nfit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides\r\na modifier. See the tables below for test difficulties.\nCrafting Difficulty\nQuality\nDifficulty\nInferior\nCommon\nSuperior\n+30\n+0\n-30\nMaterial Difficulty (Smithing)\nMaterial\nDifficulty Material\nDifficulty\nAdamantium\nBonemold\nBone\nChitin\nDragonbone/\r\nDragonscale\nDreugh Hide\nDwemer\nEbony\nFur\nIron\n-20\n-5\n+0\n+0\n-40\n-10\n-10\n-30\n+10\n+20\nLeather\nMalachite\nMithril\nMoonstone\nOrichalcum\nPadded\nSilver\nStahlrim\nSteel\nWood\n+10\n-20\n-10\n-10\n-10\n+30\n-5\n-10\n+0\n+20\nStep 4: Make Crafting Test\r\nNext the character makes the actual crafting test using the diffi-\r\nculty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character\r\ntests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons\r\nor armor uses the Profession [Smithing] skill, while other items\r\nwill usually use some other variation of the Profession [Field]\r\nskill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical\r\nsuccess halves the time required.\nCreating any item requires the appropriate craft tools. In the\r\ncase of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge\r\n(along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete\r\nthe product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from\r\na few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During\r\nthis time the character must be focused on creating the item.\r\nThe duration required is left to the GM and should be based\r\non the complexity of the item in question.\nRuned Weapons &amp; Armor\r\nCharacters with knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons\r\nand armor with magic runes that make them effective against\r\ncertain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant\r\ntest when creating the item. On success, add the Magic quality\r\nto the armor or weapon. On failure, the item is created without\r\nthe Magic quality and the test cannot be repeated for this item.\nRepairing Weapons &amp; Armor\r\nMuch like people, gear does not always survive combat. In the\r\nevent that a weapon or piece of armor is damaged, a character\r\ncan attempt to repair it with a Profession [Smithing] skill test.\r\nThis takes about an hour and requires raw materials worth five\r\npercent of the price of the item. Given a successful skill test, the\r\ncharacter can reduce the X value of the Damaged (X) weapon/\r\narmor quality on the damaged item by their degrees of success.\nDaedric Weapons &amp; Armor\r\nThe Daedra are undisputed masters of craftsmanship, and it\r\nis possible for mortals to utilize many of their secret ritual\r\ntechniques to create Daedric armor and weaponry, which draw\r\npower from a Daedric soul consumed during the creation of\r\nthe item itself. However, detailed knowledge of the specifics of\r\nthis process can be hard to come across.\nDaedric equipment is made by binding Daedric essence to ebony.\r\nAs such, the process for creating Daedric armor or weaponry\r\nis mostly the same as it would be for the ebony equivalent but\r\nwith a -40 penalty to the crafting test rather than the usual -30.\r\nAdditionally, the character may only work at night and must\r\nhave a Soul Gem containing the captured soul of a Daedra.\nHalfway through the process the character must make a -10\r\nEnchant skill test. On failure they are unable to bind the soul\n188\n\fproperly and the only thing that they can salvage from their\r\nefforts is the ebony version of the item. On success, the soul is\r\nbound to the item and its power begins to twist the item into\r\nits Daedric form. The Willpower of the captured Daedra caps\r\nthe items quality as specified below. Either way, the soul gem\r\nis destroyed and the energy within is lost.\nDaedra Willpower Requirements\nQuality\nDaedras\r\nWillpower\nInferior\nCommon\nSuperior\n&lt;40\n40-64\n65+\n189"},"Chapter_4_Talents_-and-_Traits/Chapter_4_Talents_-and-_Traits":{"slug":"Chapter_4_Talents_-and-_Traits/Chapter_4_Talents_-and-_Traits","filePath":"Chapter_4_Talents_&_Traits/Chapter_4_Talents_&_Traits.md","title":"Chapter_4_Talents_&_Traits","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 4: Talents &amp; Traits\nLike a sudden, violent snow squall that rends travelers blind and threatens to tear loose the very foundations\r\nof the sturdiest hall, the Snow Prince did sweep into our numbers. Indeed the ice and snow did begin to swirl and churn\r\nabout the Elf, as if called upon to serve his bidding. The spinning of that gleaming spear whistled a dirge to all those\r\nwho would stand in the way of the Snow Prince, and our mightiest fell before him that day.\nFall of the Snow Prince\n\fSkills are not the only way a characters abilities can be mea-\nsured. Talents and traits are important parts of any Character.\nTalents are the various unique abilities the character has come to\r\npossess through training or experience. They include everything\r\nfrom passive bonuses to activated abilities and can even modify\r\nhow the character uses certain skills. Traits are rules that reflect\r\nvarious natural facts about the character or certain abilities they\r\npossess, such as the ability to fly or see in the dark.\nLearning Talents\r\nThe XP cost to learn a talent is based on that talents level.\r\nCharacters must fulfill all requirements for a talent in order to\r\nlearn it. Learning talents governed by a favored characteristic\r\ncosts 75% of the regular XP cost (round down to the nearest\r\nmultiple of 5).\r\nCore talentS\nMost talents have a Governing Characteristic on which\r\nthey are based. Talents governed by one of a characters favored\r\ncharacteristics cost less. Some talents have more than one gov-\r\nerning characteristic, in which case only one of them needs to\r\nbe favored to reduce the cost (there is no bonus for having more\r\nthan one of them favored). Some have none, in which case the\r\ncharacter does not need to meet any characteristic requirements\r\nand simply pays the base cost.\nThe following sections divide talents into categories and offer\r\ndescriptions and prerequisites for each.\nTalent Levels\r\nEach talent has an associated Talent Level. Talents of higher\r\nlevels have more powerful effects, as they represent more pow-\r\nerful abilities that are more difficult to acquire. The level of\r\nthe talent determines the XP cost of that talent. The level also\r\ndetermines a talents characteristic requirements. A character\r\nmust meet the base characteristic score requirement (unmodified\r\nby external effects) of at least one of the talents governing\r\ncharacteristics before they can purchase it. Some talents have\r\nadditional requirements, which will be listed with those talents.\nIf a talent has no listed governing characteristic, then there is\r\nno need to meet any characteristic requirements and the talents\r\ncost is always reduced as if it was governed by the characters\r\nfavored characteristic.\nCore Talents form the backbone of your characters abilities and\r\nstrengths in the world of Tamriel. Within this segment, youll\r\nencounter an array of diverse talents that define your characters\r\nprowess across various aspects of the game. These talents serve as\r\nthe building blocks for your characters combat ability, magical\r\naptitude, interactions with the world, and much more.\nAwareness\r\nAwareness talents focus on enhancing a characters ability to\r\nperceive their environment and glean information about others.\nCombat Senses\r\nThe character has keen combat instincts.\r\nNovice (Perception)\r\nThe character can choose to calculate their Initiative Rating  by\r\ntaking twice their Perception Bonus and adding two instead of\r\nthe usual formula.\nHoned Senses\r\nThe character has honed their physical senses beyond the capabilities\r\nof the average person through training or experience.\r\nApprentice (Perception)\r\nThe character has honed their senses so that they can partially\r\ncompensate for the loss of one with the others. Halves all pen-\r\nalties imposed on any tests by the loss or impairment of one\r\nsense (bad lighting, blindness, deafness, and so on) as long as\r\nthey have the others to fall back on.\nTalent Costs and Requirements\nTalent Level\nXP Cost\nCharacteristic\r\nRequirement\nNovice\nApprentice\nJourneyman\nAdept\nExpert\nMaster\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n800\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nOne with All\r\nThe character has honed their senses to the peak of their capabilities.\r\nExpert (Perception)\r\nRequires/Replaces Honed Senses\r\nThe character has honed their senses so that they can entirely\r\ncompensate for the loss of one with the others.

This stacks\r\nwith any other penalties to shock tests.\nKilling Blow\r\nThe character can put all of themself into a single attack aimed\r\nto end the fight.\r\nMaster (Strength)\r\nRequires Crippling Strikes\r\nWhen the character spends a Stamina point to make a power\r\nattack, they add three times the amount of stamina spent to\r\na maximum of 3SP for +9 damage.\nDauntless Bulwark\r\nThe character positions themself at the front of any fight and strives\r\nalways to protect their allies from harm.\r\nJourneyman (Strength, Endurance)\r\nOpponents within the characters melee range cannot make\r\nattacks of opportunity against this characters allies.\nDefender\r\nThe character is willing to step in and take a hit for their allies.\r\nJourneyman (Endurance, Willpower, Perception)\r\nAs a 1 AP reaction the character can switch positions with an ally\r\nwithin 2 meters if that ally is attacked.

The Type, Damage, and Range together specify\r\nthe complete profile for the characters natural weapons. This\r\noverrides the default natural weapons profile and they cannot\r\nbe disarmed. Default Natural Weapons profiles can be found\r\nin Unarmed Combat on page 104. Natural Weapons cannot\r\nbe enchanted.\nPower Well (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait have more magicka than usual. The\r\nsize of their Magicka Pool is increased by X. If the character\r\nwould receive this trait twice, combine the X values.\nQuadruped\r\nCharacters with this trait move up to twice their speed when\r\nthey use the Dash action and three times their speed when they\r\nuse the Sprint stamina ability.\nRegeneration (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait heal very quickly. They may make\r\nan Endurance test at the start of each round to heal X HP.\r\nThis does not count as magical healing unless applied by some\r\nmagical source.\nResistance (*, X)\r\nCharacters with this trait reduce damage of * type by X after\r\nany other mitigation and gain a +10 bonus per X to tests made\r\nto resist non-damaging effects of the listed type.\nIn cases where a roll is made against one of this character’s\r\nCharacteristics, increase that characteristic by 10 * X for the\r\npurposes of resolving that roll.\nResist Normal Weapons (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait are resistant to mundane weapons.\r\nIf the character suffers damage from a weapon/attack without\r\nthe Magic quality, reduce that damage by X after any other\r\nmitigation.\nRunning Out of Luck\r\nThe characters luck is running out. Whenever they would burn\r\nany amount of Luck, burn twice that amount. If the character\r\ndoes not have this much Luck remaining, just burn all remaining\r\nLuck.\nSavage\r\nThe character treats weapons that they wield (including Natural\r\nWeapons) as if they had the Proven Weapon Quality. If the\r\nWeapon has the Primitive Quality, then the character treats the\r\nweapon as having neither Quality.\n92\nIncorporeal\r\nIncorporeal characters are spirits, faintly visible and capable of\r\nmoving through objects. They gain the Flyer (Speed) trait and\r\nmay use it to freely move through solid objects. They can be\r\ntargeted by attacks, but they cannot suffer damage except from\r\nmagic damage or damage from attacks with the Magic quality.\nIncorporeal characters do not normally affect the world, but they\r\ncan use magic and make attacks that are capable of damaging\r\nnon-incorporeal beings. Attacks from Incorporeal characters\r\nignore all AR from any armor that does not have the Magic\r\nquality and cannot be blocked by shields without that quality.\nNatural Toughness (X)\r\nThe character with this trait is naturally tough and reduces\r\nincoming damage of all types by X. This functions like AR for\r\nthe purposes of reducing damage, but it does not count as armor.\n\fSilver-Scarred (X)\r\nAny damage inflicted on a character with this trait after mitiga-\r\ntion by an attack from a silver weapon is increased by X before\r\ncalculating the effects of the damage.\r\nSkeletal\r\nCharacters with this trait have purely skeletal forms. Attempts to\r\nhit them with ranged weapons suffer a -20 penalty. Characters\r\nwith this trait also automatically gain the Undead trait as well\r\nand are immune to the Burning (X) condition.\nSpell Absorption (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait absorb a portion of  the magic directed\r\nat them to fuel their own magicka reserves. Whenever magic\r\nfrom another source/character affects them, roll a d10. If the\r\nvalue is less than or equal to X, the magic has no effect on them;\r\ninstead, they regain missing MP up to the cost of the magic.\nIf a character with this trait would be affected by the Reflect\r\nspell, then the effects of each should be resolved in the reverse\r\norder to which they were applied.\nFor example, if a character with this trait has the Reflect spell\r\neffect applied to them after this trait is applied, then when the\r\ncharacter is affected by another spell effect they would resolve\r\nReflect against that effect first, then Spell Aborption if the effect\r\nis not reflected.\nStrong Jaws\r\nA Bite attack made by this character that deals damage auto-\r\nmatically starts a Grapple. The test to contest this Grapple is\r\nmade against the original test made by the attacker. If the target\r\nCounter Attacks a Bite attack, the Counter Attack ignores the\r\ncreatures AR and Natural Toughness trait.\nStunted Magicka\r\nCharacters with this trait do not regenerate magicka naturally\r\nand halve the benefits (round down) gained from Spell Restraint.\nSummoned\r\nThis creature or item has been conjured from another plane of\r\nexistence. Upon its death or destruction, it returns to where it\r\ncame from immediately.\nSun-Scarred (X)\r\nAny damage inflicted on a character with this trait after mit-\r\nigation by an attack that counts as sunlight is increased by X\r\nbefore calculating the effects of the damage.\nIf this character is exposed to normal sunlight they lose 1 SP\r\neach hour. Cloud cover or other such weather halves the rate of\r\nSP loss. The character must spend an hour in a dark place before\r\nthey can remove levels of fatigue/regain SP lost in this manner.\nSwimmer\r\nThe characters Swim Speed is doubled.\nTelepathy (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait can communicate with others tele-\r\npathically. They are capable of broadcasting thoughts to a\r\nmaximum number of characters equal to their WB within\r\na number of meters equal to one hundred times their WB.\r\nThey must have line of sight to the character to whom they are\r\nbroadcasting, unless the target character has this trait as well.\nCharacters with this trait can make a Perception test as a free\r\naction to attempt to locate other characters with this trait within\r\ntheir broadcast range, though this test can be opposed by a\r\nWillpower test if a character wishes to remain hidden.\nThe strength X of this trait determines the complexity of the\r\nthoughts they can broadcast.\nTelepathic Strength\nMaximum Message Complexity\nA single word\nA short sentence.\nA full sentence.\nX\n1\n2\n3\n4 Up to five sentences.\n5\n6\nAs many words as the character desires.\nImages.\n7+ Complex feelings and concepts.\nThis trait can stack by adding together values of X.\nThick Skull\r\nImmune to Stun and Dazed.\nVicious (X)\r\nThe creature treats their SB as being X for the purposes of\r\nresolving damage. This does not effect the character’s Strength\r\nCharacteristic Score.\nTelekinesis (X)\r\nCharacters with this trait can move objects with their mind\r\nwithin a range of 10 * X meters. This can only be used to move\r\nfairly small objects (at most a large crate or barrel) at a speed of\r\nabout 1 meter per second (6 per round).\nThe character can also throw an object at an opponent. This is\r\na Primary Action and a Ranged Attack, and it uses Mysticism\r\n(Willpower) for the test. Any object used in this manner counts\r\nas an improvised weapon and can only be thrown a distance\r\nof WB * 2 meters.\n93\n\fTerrifying (X)\r\nThose who encounter this character must immediately make\r\na Horror (X) test.\nTough (X)\r\nIncrease Wound Threshold by X.\nOptional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds\r\nIf youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in\r\nPhysical Health on page 109, replace the text for the\r\nTough trait with “Character gains a +(10 * X) bonus to\r\nShock Tests”.\nUndead\r\nCharacters with this trait are mere walking corpses. They do\r\nnot breathe or require organs to function. They are immune\r\nto things such as disease, poison, passive wound effects, aging,\r\nfatigue, and a number of conditions including but not limited\r\nto dazed, deafened, and organ damage. Use common sense\r\nwhen deciding what can and cannot affect characters with this\r\ntrait. The character cannot spend Stamina Points if doing so\r\nwould bring their current SP to below 0.\nUndying\r\nCharacters are free from most concerns of the living. They are\r\nimmune to disease and the effects of aging.\nUnnatural Senses (*, X)\r\nThe character with this trait can perceive its surroundings using\r\nadditional and/or different senses than the usual. Their Senses\r\nallow them to detect the things specified by * within range of X\r\nmeters (even through solid objects). If * is all then their Senses\r\nhave been replaced entirely, and they can simply see normally\r\nthrough solid objects up to X meters away.\nWeak Bones (X)\r\nReduce Wound Threshold by X.\nWeakness (*, X)\r\nCharacters with this trait are weak to a certain damage or effect\r\ntype. They increase damage of * type by X after any other mit-\r\nigation and suffer a -10 penalty per X to tests made to resist\r\nnon-damaging effects of this type.\nIf this trait would stack for a single damage type, instead only\r\napply the highest value of X. Different values of * damage type\r\nare considered different traits.\nIn cases where a roll is being made against one of this character’s\r\nCharacteristics, decrease that characteristic by 10 * X for the\r\npurposes of resolving that roll.\n94"},"Chapter_8_Elite_Advances/Chapter_8_Elite_Advances":{"slug":"Chapter_8_Elite_Advances/Chapter_8_Elite_Advances","filePath":"Chapter_8_Elite_Advances/Chapter_8_Elite_Advances.md","title":"Chapter_8_Elite_Advances","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Chapter 8: Elite Advances\nSo many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. Its a very sad state of affairs,\nwhen the game is really open to all, you dont need an invitation. And it is a game, the game of bargaining, to be\nplayed seriously and, I hasten to add, politely.\nThe Buying Game\n\fWithin this chapter lies the path to extraordinary power and\nlegendary prowess, where characters transcend beyond\ntheir already formidable abilities. These Elite Advances are not\nmere steps in a characters journey, but leaps into realms of\nalmost mythic capabilities.\nIts important to note that Elite Advances are not intended for\ncharacter creation except for in hight XP starts. They repre-\nsent a level of power and knowledge that is typically beyond\nthe reach of novice or even intermediate adventurers. These\nadvanced paths are optional and are best introduced with great\nconsideration. Game Masters should consider the inclusion of\nElite Advances on a per-character basis, ensuring that it aligns\nwell with the characters development, the narrative, and the\noverall balance of your campaign.\nMoreover, we strongly encourage Game Masters to introduce\nElite Advances through the games narrative. These extraordinary\npowers should feel like an integral part of the world their players\nare exploring. GMs should consider weaving these opportunities\ninto their story, allowing characters to discover and pursue them\nthrough their in-game actions and choices. This approach not\nonly enhances the immersion but also maintains the organic\nflow of the story.\nElite Advances should feel like hard-earned rewards or significant\nmilestones in a characters journey. Whether its uncovering\nancient secrets, undergoing rigorous training, or being chosen\nby the gods, the path to these powers should be as memorable\nas the abilities themselves.\nAs you venture into this chapter, consider the impact and pos-\nsibilities these Elite Advances bring. They are tools to elevate a\ncampaign and provide players with experiences that are truly\nlegendary.\nWhite-Gold Artificer\nThe character is privy to the ancient lores and starlight-forges\nof the Ayleidoon.\n250 XP if an Ayleid, burn 10 Luck if not an Ayleid.\nThe character is able to learn new Ayleid crafting talents, and\nwhen they use a Welkynd Stone to replenish Magicka, can\ntest Willpower to only drain the Stone instead of destroy it.\nWhen using a Welkynd or Varla Stone, the character can test\nEnchanting at +0. If successful, the Welkynd or Varla Stone is\nnot consumed by the character, only drained of its power.\n|\nTalents\nPatterns of the Ayleids\nAdept (Intelligence)\nRequires Adept Profession[Smithing], Adept Lore, White-\nGold Artificer\nThe character has learned the secrets of forging the weapons\nand armour used by the ancient Ayleids, which are blessed by\nstarlight. The character can create Welkynd Moonstone and\nVarla Malachite Armour and Weapons.\nAncient Secrets\nMaster (Intelligence)\nRequires Patterns of the Ayleids\nThe character has unlocked the secrets of starlight and, with\nthe right materials and timing, can restore power to and create\nWelkynd and Varla stones. The character learns the Siphon\nStarlight and Create Ayleid Stone rituals.\nAyleid Equipment\nWelkynd Equipment\nWhen forging Moonstone armour or weapons, a character who\nhas the Patterns of the Ayleids talent can imbue the magic-\nka-containing powers of Welkynd Stone into the piece by\ncatalyzing an intact Welkynd Stone or by using 10 Pinches of\nWelkynd Stone Dust (see Welkynd Stones entry). The character\ncrafts the piece as normal, but limits the Profession[Smithing]\ntest by the characters choice of Lore or Mysticism. If the test\nwould normally pass for Blacksmithing but fails due to the\nlimiting skill, the armour is created as Moonstone, and is not\nsuccessfully imbued with the power of the Ayleids.\nIf successful, the weapon or armour piece is imbued with the\npower of Welkynd Stones. It is treated exactly as Moonstone,\nThough it gains one of the following Armor or Weapon Qualities\nas appropriate.\nWelkynd Armor Quality\nIf you are targeted by a spell, roll a d10. On a roll of 3 or\nlower, the spell effect does not resolve and the Magicka spent\non the spell is conducted through the powdered and lacquered\nWelkynd dust woven into the armour and added to the char-\nacters Magicka Points.\nWelkynd Weapon Quality\nThe weapon also gains the Focus quality, and gains one charge\nof Starlight. The character can spend a charge of Starlight to\ngain a +20 bonus to the casting test of a spell while weilding\nthis weapon. The weapon, if left under starlight for at least 4\nhours, regains one spent charge. It can only hold up to three\ncharges at a time. Additionally, Welkynd weapons can cast up\n191\n\fto 10m of bright light as a free action.\nthe purpose of being magically dispelled.\nVarla Equipment\nWhen forging Malachite armour, a character can imbue the\nmagicka-containing powers of a Varla Stone into the piece\nby catalyzing an intact Varla Stone, or by using 10 Pinches of\nVarla Stone Dust (see Varla Stones entry). The character crafts\nthe piece as normal, but limits the Blacksmithing test by their\nLore and Mysticism skills. If failed, if the test would normally\npass for Blacksmithing, the armour is created as Malachite and\nis not successfully imbued with the power of the Ayleids.\nIf successful, the weapon or armour piece is imbued with the\npower of Varla Stones. It is treated exactly as Malachite, though\nit gains one of the following properties\nVarla Armor Quality\nIf you are targeted by a spell, roll a d10. On a roll of 5 or\nlower, the spell effect does not resolve and the Magicka spent\non the spell is conducted through the powdered and lacquered\nWelkynd dust woven into the armour and added to the char-\nacters Magicka Points.\nVarla Weapon Quality\nThe weapon also gains the Focus quality, and gains two charges\nof Starlight. The character can spend a charge of Starlight to\ngain a +30 bonus to the casting test of a spell while weilding\nthis weapon. The weapon, if left under starlight for at least 4\nhours, regains one spent charge. It can only hold up to five\ncharges at a time. Additionally, Welkynd weapons can cast up\nto 15m of bright light as a free action.\nWelkynd Lanterns\nA Welkynd lantern runs not on oil or candle, but by magicka\nusing a harvested and refined Welkynd crystal. Easily used and\noperated and requiring only a modest amount of magicka, a\nWelkynd lantern can cast great light in a staggeringly large radius,\nor be used to quietly and dimly light an area.\nA Welkynd lantern is a light source that weighs 1 ENC. Because\nit is magical, it stays lit even while underwater, in Oblivion, or\nanywhere else that might prevent conventional fires from being\nlit, and also does not give off an odor, sound, or smoke.\nAs an action, a character can light a Welkynd lantern by touching\nit. Doing so, they can expend up to 10 Magicka Points. Each\npoint of magicka spent allows it to cast bright light for up to\n10m  (magicka spent) for 4 hours. The character can touch\nthe lantern to extinguish it, but relighting it will cost the full\nMP cost again if they chose to do so.\nThe Welkynd Lanterns light effect is treated as Spell Level 3 for\nWelkynd Stones\nWelkynd Stones are aquamarine stones commonly found in\nayleid cities, with meteoric iron bases. A character can harness\nthe power of a Welkynd Stone with a Secondary Cast Magic\nAction, after which the character drains the stone of its power\nand is restored to full Magicka points. The stone then crumbles\naway into a Pinch of Welkynd Stone Dust.\nDark Welkynd Stones\nSmall crystals of black-light, an inversion of their aqueous-blue\ncousins, Dark Welkynd Stones are imbued with sorcerous power\nand are left suspended by magic to act as simple sentinels.\nA character with an inert Dark Welkynd Stone can power it\nwith a successful -20 Mysticism test as a Cast Magic Secondary\nAction. While activated, the Dark Welkynd Stone will float\nabout a meter off the ground and can be moved by pushing\nor carrying it around. The character can then nominate either\ntargets to be attacked or targets to be ignored. The character\ncan then cast a Destruction spell up to spell level 2 into the\nDark Welkynd Stone causing the crystal to imbued with this\nspell. A Dark Welkynd Stone can only be imbued with 1 spell\nat any given time.\nThe Dark Welkynd Stone will, once per round, cast this spell\nas a Bolt at the nearest eligible target (always succeeds with\n1 DoS) until the character passes a +20 Mysticism test as\na Cast Magic Secondary Action to make it stop, or it runs\nout of Magicka. The character must manually charge it with\ntheir own Magicka as an Action, transferring as much of their\nown available Magicka into it as they wish as a +0 Mysticism\ntest. The Dark Welkynd Stone holds up to 100 Magicka.\nVarla Stones\nVarla Stones are white, luminescent stones created from\nenchanted shards of meteoric glass. They are quite rare, even\nfor ayleid ruins, as they have been mostly picked clean due to\ntheir powerful ability to recharge magic items.\nA character can harness the power of a Varla Stone by using\na Secondary Cast Magic Action and choosing an Enchanted\nItem, after which the character drains the stone of its power\nand restores up to 1000 of the chosen items Soul Energy. The\nstone then crumbles away into a Pinch of Varla Stone Dust.\nImbuing Equipment\nWhen forging equipment with Moonstone or Malachite, a\ncharacter possessing the Patterns of the Ayleids talent can imbue\nit with the magicka-containing powers of Ayleid Stones. For\nMoonstone equipment, use Welkynd Stones, and for Malachite,\n192\n\fthe ritual. Once the test is successful, the character places the\nstone at the center of this ritually prepared area. The stone must\nthen be left undisturbed overnight. By morning, if the ritual is\nuninterrupted, the stone will have regained its charge and will\nfunction as intended.\nuse Varla Stones. This is achieved by catalyzing an intact stone\nor using 10 Pinches of the respective Stones Dust.\nThe crafting process follows the normal procedure, but the\nProfession[Smithing] test is limited by the characters Lore or\nMysticism skills. Should the test fail due to these limiting skills\nwhile it would normally pass for Blacksmithing, the item is cre-\nated as standard Moonstone or Malachite without the Ayleidic\npowers. On a success, the item gains one of the appropriate\nweapon or armor qualities for the type (Varla or Welkynd).\nAyleid Rituals\nThe creation of Welkynd and Varla stones was a secret closely\nguarded by the Ayleid people. With time and very meticulous\nresearch, few individuals outside the Ayleids have uncovered\nthe secret rituals known to fabricate them.\nCreate Welkynd Stone\nTo create a Welkynd stone, the character must accrue approxi-\nmately 150 drakes worth of materials and any valuable gemstone\nwith exception of a Diamond. Then the character may make a\n-10 Profession[Smithing] test followed by a -10 Enchanting test\nto create the stone. If the gemstone used to make the Welkynd\nstone is one of those listed below, activating it grants one of the\nfollowing effects until the characters next long rest in addition\nto the standard effect. These effects do not stack with themselves.\nAmethyst: Character gains Resistance(Magic, 2)\nEmerald: Character increases their SP max by 1.\nRuby: Character increases their max HP by 3.\nSaphhire: Character gains Power Well(10).\nGarnet: Character increases their Wound Threshold by 1.\nIf any of these gemstones happen to be flawless, both of the\ntests made to create the stone become -30, and the effects of\neach stone are doubled.\nCreate Varla Stone\nTo create a Varla stone, the character must accrue approximately\n250 drakes worth of materials and a diamond gemstone. Then the\ncharacter must make a +0 Profession[Smithing] test followed by\na +0 Enchanting test to create the stone. Once created, this stone\nfunctions the same as any other Varla stone. If the Diamond\nis flawless, then the tests become -20 and the resulting Varla\nstone can be used to fully recharge an enchanted item 3 times\nbefore it crumbles into dust.\nSiphon Starlight\nThis ritual allows a character to draw energy from the stars to\nrecharge Welkynd and Varla stones, either newly crafted or those\nthat have lost their charge. To perform this ritual, the character\nmust first prepare a designated area outdoors under the night\nsky using materials costing approximately 100 drakes. Following\nthis, they undertake a Lore test with a -20 penalty to initiate\n193\n\flichdom\nsoul destroyed.\nThe second stage simply requires that the character remain bound\nto the Phylactery for one week. The third and final stage is a ritual,\ncompleted on the last day of the second stage. Completing this\nritual requires a Necromancy skill test with a -30 penalty, and\nseveral hours. The ritual culminates at the precise moment that\nthe transfer of the characters soul to and from the Phylactery\ncompletes: the character is simultaneously killed and his soul is\nre-bound to his body. He is now a Lich, and is no longer bound\nto the Phylactery in any way: apply the appropriate effects.\nIf the character fails the test, failed the test for the rites in the\nfirst stage, or the ritual is interrupted somehow, then the Lich\nis killed instantly and their soul destroyed.\nIf a Lich does not preserve its body with the Rite of Mortal\nTranscendence, when it reaches its natural age of death, its body\nwill die, though its spirit will continue to inhabit it, and it will\nbegin to rot away over about a month, and have its Personality\nreduced to 5, and gain the Skeletal trait.\nLich Traits\nDark Sight\nImmune to Frost.\nResistance (Shock, Normal Weapons, 3).\nPower Well (25)\nSkeletal Claws: 1d8 Slashing, Reaach 1m\nUndead: The Lich does not eat, breath, or require organs\nto function. The Lich is immune to disease, poison, passive\nwound effects, aging, Fatigue, Dazed, Deafened, and Organ\nDamage. Liches cannot take actions that would cause them\nfatigue.\nSpecial Abilities\nDark Ceremony\nCost: 1 SP + [15 x corpse] Magicka\nAs a Primary Cast Magic Action, the Lich can immediately raise\na number of nearby corpses up to their WB for 1 minute, using\nthe profile of Zombies. They will attack any living beings nearby,\nand are not bound to the will of the Lich, but they will not be\nhostile to them either. This is not spell :)\n|Liches are necromancers who have embraced undeath: they have\nused an object known as a Phylactery to transfer their soul out of\ntheir body so that it might be bound to them again at the moment\nof their death, thus rendering themselves immortal, undead beings.\nLiches are resistant to several elements, and able to harness more\nmagicka for spells (a side effect of the transformation process).\nThe character has completed the Rite of Unlife Ritual successfully\nand has become a Lich.\nRequires 500 XP The Rite of Unlife having been successfully\ncompleted.\nThe Rite of Unlife\nThis ritual can be purchased outside of having the Lichdom Elite\nAdvance, being a prerequisite of it.\nLichdom is achieved through the Rite of Unlife, an advanced\nritual known only to a select few. Becoming a Lich is not a simple\ntask, and simply learning the details of the Rite of Unlife is a\ndifficult task. If a character manages to discover the secret (such\nas by finding a copy of the forbidden Tome of Unlife) then they\ncan perform it themselves using the following steps:\nBecoming a Lich essentially requires enchanting ones corpse with\nones own soul. This is a three step process, and takes roughly\ntwo weeks. First, a number of minor rituals are performed\nwhich result in the characters soul being bound to a temporary\nstorage vessel, known as a Phylactery. Second, the character\nmust remain near the Phylactery for several days as the transfer\nof his soul completes.\nFinally, a third ritual is performed, ending at the exact moment\nthe transfer completes. During this phase, the character dies, and\nhis soul is re-bound to his corpse, granting him full Lichdom.\nIn game terms, the first stage requires a week long set of rituals to\nprepare the Phylactery, and the characters body, for the transition\nto undeath. Successfully completing these rites requires passing\na single -20 Necromancy skill test. The GM should make this\ntest for the character in secret, and note the results. The rites\nthemselves will vary depending on the source from which the\ncharacter learns of them, but they invariably require a number of\ngruesome components (the details of which are left to the GM).\nThe character must also choose an object to be their Phylactery.\nAfter the Phylactery is chosen and the preparatory rites are\ncomplete, the character is then bound to the Phylactery. If this\nobject passes further than 3 meters away from them while they\nare bound to it, then the character is killed instantly and their\n194\n\fPAin Sorcerer\nThe Ayleids were a very cruel race, and their love of pain and torture,\nas well as their worship of Daedra led them to create a very sick\nand twisted magic based on manipulating the flesh of their enemies,\nand even sometimes themselves.\nDisclaimer: The rules for this elite advance play with\nsome heavy themes of torture and pain in general.\nThe character is studied in the arts of dark flesh-magic, and is\nfuelled by the pain and torment of others.\n1000 XP if an Ayleid or is being trained, otherwise 1500XP.\nThe character has access to the Flesh Magic skill, and generates a\nPain Point (PP) any time a living creature or character within\ntheir Perception in metres is slain, Wounded, Burning, Bleeding,\nor fails a Fear or Horror test, or otherwise suffers excruciating\npain and torture.\nAn event that causes multiple of these effects to a single target\nonly grants a single Pain Point. For a target to considered eligible,\nthey must be living and sentient. The Flesh Shaper can store a\nnumber of Pain Points equal to half their Willpower score. All\nPain Points are lost after a Long Rest.\nNew Skill: Flesh Magic (Int, Wp)\nWielded by ancient Ayleid sorcerers, Flesh Magic is used to twist,\ngnarl, warp, and change the living form. Fueled by agonies and\nfoul murder, Flesh Magic is potent, cruel, and terrible. The GM\nmay ask you to test Flesh Magic when:\nCasting a Flesh Magic Spell.\nIdentifying the effects of a Flesh Magic Spell.\nPerforming Flesh Magic Rituals.\nAyleid Flesh Magic\nUnlike conventional magic, Flesh Magic is fuelled by Pain Points\n(PP), which are gained from the Pain Sorcerer Elite Advance.\nThe caster should declare their target or targets and test to\nsuccessfully cast the spell. If failed, the caster loses a number\nof Pain Points equal to the number of targets selected and the\nbase cost of the spell, and gains +1 Corruption Score.\nIf successful, the caster then chooses how many Pain Points\nto invest in the spell. Pain Points purchase one additional\nspell d10. Additionally, the caster can pay one Pain Point per\nadditional target beyond the first. The caster then rolls all\nd10s and applies the effects based on whether or not the\ntotal exceeds the target(s)s Endurance score. After the effects\nof a Flesh Magic spell wear off, the target immediately loses\na Stamina Point. Flesh Magic spells have a range of the users\nPerception in meters.\nExample: A pain sorcerer with a +30 in Flesh Magic casts Harden\nFlesh on himself, and commits 4 Pain Points to it. He successfully\ncasts, and now must roll 4 d10, one for every PP spent. The Pain\nSorcerer has an Endurance score of 31, and therefore on his 4d10\nroll must meet or beat 31. He rolls his 4d10 pool and the total\ncomes out to 28, just shy! Instead of gaining Natural Toughness 3\nfor 1 minute, he instead gains Natural Toughness 1 for 1 minute.\nCorruption\nEach time a characters Corruption Score exceeds their Endurance\nBonus, they must roll a d20 on the table in Corruption Effects\non page 198 and reset their Corruption Score back to 0.\nCorruption Effects represent malignancies, addiction to pain,\nand pathos that develop in the character absent the indulgences\nof agony.

The arm cannot be used\nfor any normal purposes, but counts as a Broadsword (d8)+1\nwith the Magical trait, and gains Slashing (Casters WB) for one\nminute, which uses the characters Unarmed or Broadsword\nskill for attacks and defence.\nIf the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the targets\narm instead bloats and calcifies. This arm counts as Crippled\nand gains the Crushing(SB) and Magical Qualities for one\nround, after which the arms swelling returns to normal and the\ncalcification sloughs off.

Corruption represents malignancies, addiction to pain, and pathos that develop in the\ncharacter absent the indulgences of agony. Whenever the character has less total Pain Points stored than they have total number\nof Corruptions, they suffer the effects of their Corruptions.\nD20\nCorruption Effect\n1 The character has violent shaking fits, and suffers a -10 on all Agility based tests.\n2 The characters eyes go bloodshot and cloudy, forcing a -10 on all Observe tests.\n3\nThe characters skin tightens to their bones like an ancient hags, giving them a shrivelled appearance and reducing their maximum\nStamina by 1.\n4 The character is overwhelmingly drowsy and exhausted, and suffers 1 level of Fatigue until their pain-thirst is slaked.\n5 The character is wracked with unnerving ticks, and suffers a -10 on all Personality based tests.\n6 The character wastes away and their muscles atrophy, and suffers a -10 penalty on all Strength based tests.\n7 The characters skin erupts into painful sores, and gains the Bleeding (1) condition any time they take damage.\n8\n9\nThe characters constitution falters and they are sick to their stomach, and suffer a -10 on all Endurance based tests except those to\nresist Death.\nThe characters eyes become sensitive to bright light, and suffer a -10 penalty on all vision based tests made in daylight or bright\ntorchlight.\n10 The character becomes antipathic and withdrawn, and suffers a -20 on all Command, Commerce, and Persuade tests.\n11\nThe character becomes violently ill, and must test Endurance once per day at GM discretion.

They may now turn every 1 PP they\nhave into 2 MP.\nBlood Magic\nThe character has developed vampiric tendencies and can use their\nlife essence to cast their Flesh Magic spells.\nMaster (Willpower)\nExperimenting with their own body, and taking a bit of inspi-\nration from more vampiric magic, the caster can now expend\nHP in place of PP at 1:1 ratio.\nRed Osmosis\nThe character can meditate during a rest and sacrifice their power\nto heal themselves of their injuries at a faster pace.\nMaster (Intelligence)\nMeditating on their own wicked deeds while resting, the caster\ncan now convert leftover PP into HP during a long rest at a 2:1\nratio, and 5:1 during a short rest.\nDark Inspiration\nUsing their dark power, the character can now make themselves\nappeal more to others.\nExpert (Intelligence)\nThe character has harnessed the power of pain to boost their\nmental capacity and charismatic prowess.

When the Pain\nSorcerer gains a Pain Point from a character or creature being\nslain or Wounded, they instead gain 2 Paint Points.\nPain Rituals\nRituals involving torture, pain, suffering, and harnessing moon-\nlight. Most revolve in creating a ritually prepared area, and\nboosting the effectiveness of any Flesh Magic casted within\nthat area.\nRite of Desecration\nThis ritual requires a medium sized to large sized room to be\nprepared with various amounts of different rituals and incanta-\ntions cast around the room. Preparing this room generally costs\n1000 Drakes, takes 1 day, and always requires the Pain Sorcerer\nto gain a random Corruption Effect from the Corruption Effects\ntable. Depending on the size of the room, It may take a shorter\nor longer amount of time or Drakes (Up to GM discretion) as\nwell as a -10 Flesh Magic skill test. On failure, repeating this\ntest only requires that the character take the same amount of\ntime to re-prepare the room.  Within this sanctum, The Pain\nSorcerer has an uncapped amount of Pain Points that are not lost\nduring a Long Rest, but only as long as they reside within the\nsanctum. If they leave the ritually prepared room, then any Pain\nPoints gained there are kept or if they exceed their maximum,\nit is reduced to their maximum amount of Pain Points.\nThis Ritual is normally used by Pain Sorcerers to cast the far\nmore powerful Pain Rituals, otherwise, they wouldnt be able\nto due to high Pain Point cost.\nRite of Transformation\nThis ritual is one of the more basic, but most powerful ritual that\na pain sorcerer may undertake. First the character must choose a\ncertain Flesh Magic spell to cast, then cast the ritual. To cast this\nritual it costs 100x the Pain Cost of the chosen Flesh Magic spell\nas well as a -30 Flesh Magic skill test. After successfully casting\n199\n\fthe chosen spell, the effects of it will become permenant upon\nthe target of the spell. This spell works on most Flesh Magic\nspells except:\nFleshmend\nSiphon Life\nHemorrhage\nTrollblood\nRite of Superior Sorcery\nThis ritual makes any pain magic spell become more effective\nand has the potential to negate any negative effects the spell\nmay inflict upon the user. For 50x the Pain Cost of a Flesh\nMagic spell, the spell does not have to exceed to the targets\nEndurance score to get the full effect of the spell, and the spell\nlasts for twice as long as it normally would. To cast this spell\nthe character must make a -20 Flesh Magic skill test.\nSWord-SinGer\nThe character is a Sword-Singer: they have devoted themselves to\nShehai Shen She Ru.\n1000 XP if a Redguard or is being trained, otherwise 1500 XP.\nThe character gains the ability to train the Shehai Shen She Ru\nskill, learn and use Techniques of Aberrant Swordsmanship,\nand learn Shehai talents.\nShehai Shen She Ru\nThe Shehai Shen She Ru, or Way of the Spirit Sword, is the\nculmination of the art of sword-singing, practiced by ancient\nRedguards in Yokuda known as Sword-Singers. The greatest\nof the Sword-Singers were known as Ansei, or Saints of the\nSword. There are several dimensions to the Shehai Shen She\nRu, each a step on the path to the title of Ansei.\nFirst is a simple devotion to swordsmanship. This is how every\nsword singer begins his journey: through intense study, and\neventual mastery, of the art of the blade. In game terms, this\nmeans that characters can utilize the Shehai Shen She Ru\nskill (with either Strength or Agility) as if it were the Combat\nStyle[Field] skill whenever wielding any type of sword (larger or\nsmaller weapons, such as daggers and greatswords, also count).\nSecond is the use of special magic techniques of the blade\nknown as Aberrant Swordsmanship. These techniques are feats\nof swordsmanship that go far beyond the capabilities of a normal\nman. The Sword-Singer accomplishes this by using a sword in a\nway that a sword simply cannot be used, an art that obviously\ntakes extensive practice. The sword singer may perform these\ntechniques with any sword, and they all require the use of the\nShehai Shen She Ru skill.\nThird, the culmination of the Way of the Spirit Sword, is the\nShehai, the spirit sword itself. The Shehai is a literal spirit sword:\na part of the soul of the Sword-Singer made manifest. A character\nwho combines the Shehai with the many techniques of Aberrant\nSwordsmanhip has become a true Ansei. Manifesting the Shehai\nalso Requires: the use of the Shehai Shen She Ru skill.\nThe following sections will deal with the latter two aspects of the\nShehai Shen She Ru: Aberrant Swordsmanship, and manifesting\nthe Shehai.\nSkill: Shehai Shen She Ru (Str, Ag, Wp)\nThe core of the Shehai Shen She Ru is a simple devotion to\nswordsmanship. This is how every Sword-Singer begins their\njourney: through intense study, and eventual mastery, of the\nart of the blade.\nCharacters can utilize the Shehai Shen She Ru skill (with either\nStrength or Agility) as if it were the Combat Style [Field] skill\nwhenever wielding any type of sword (larger or smaller weapons,\nsuch as daggers and greatswords, also count).\nWe are the ansu, the greatest warriors that live in men. Our\nswords sent the Left-Handers into the oceans, whose empire\nwas four times the size of the white king. When we fight, our\nswords can kill the laws of nature itself. Yokuda is as you\nsee it because our hira-dirg swords can cut the atomos, the\nuncuttable, and we did.\n  -The Hira-Dirge Ansei to Cyrus the Restless\n\nAbberant Swordsmanship\nThe abilities that a student of Aberrant Swordsmanship can learn\nare known simply as Techniques. Some techniques are passive\nabilities, while others are active. Using a technique requires:\na sword of some kind (either a physical one or a Shehai) and,\nfor active techniques, the use of the Shehai Shen She Ru skill.\nTechniques count as magic, though they are not spells, and\nshould thus be placed in the appropriate section of your char-\nacter sheet. Characters may learn techniques with XP. Once a\ncharacter has learned a technique, he may use it whenever he\nwants. Techniques each require a certain level of proficiency in\nthe Shehai Shen She Ru skill before they may be learned or used.\nThere are two types of techniques: active techniques and passive\ntechniques. Active techniques are specific abilities that call for\na skill test when used. Passive techniques simply apply some\nkind of bonus or effect to the character once they have been\nlearned, though some of them must be activated as Free Actions\nat the beginning of a turn or round in order to provide their\n200\n\feffect. A character must be wielding some kind of sword in\norder to benefit.\nDuring structured time, active techniques may be utilized with a\nReaction or a Cast Magic Primary or Secondary Action, depend-\ning on the technique in question unless otherwise specified. Any\nattacks they do win Advantage as normal, and they do not allow\nfor attacks of opportunity. Using an active technique requires\nthat the character follow these steps:\nStep 1: Choose Technique\nFirst, the Sword-Singer must choose a technique to utilize. They\nmay only choose a technique that they have learned and meet\nthe requirements for. A character must be wielding a sword of\nsome kind in order to utilize techniques.\nStep 2: Make Technique Test\nNext, the character makes a Shehai Shen She Ru skill (WP)\nskill test. This test is modified by the techniques difficulty as\nspecified in the techniques profile.\nStep 3: Resolve Technique\nIf the technique test was successful, apply the effects of the\ntechnique as specified in the techniques profile. If the character\nfailed the technique test, they lose X Stamina Points, where\nX is equal to the 10s digit of the Techniques difficulty (to a\nminimum of 1 Stamina Point).\nTechniques\nThis section gives an overview of each technique of Aberrant\nSwordsmanship that a character may learn. A character can only\nuse techniques that they meet the requirements for. Characters\nwho meet these requirements may learn techniques with XP.\nRemember that techniques count as magic, though they are\nnot spells, and should thus be placed in the appropriate section\nof your character sheet.\nThirty-Eight Grips\nType: Passive (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)\nCost: 200 XP\nEffect: At the beginning of a round during combat, the character\nmay choose to have one of the following effects apply until the\nbeginning of the next round:\n        The character receives an additional DoS on successful \n\nattack tests made with Shehai Shen She Ru.\n        The character receives an additional DoS on successful \n\ndefense tests made with Shehai Shen She Ru.\nAttacks the character makes have the Impaling quality.\nAttacks the character makes have the Splitting (2) quality.\nAttacks the character makes gain Crushing (2) quality.\nThe Seven Hundred and Fifty Offensive Positions\nType: Passive\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Novice)\nCost: 100 XP\nEffect: The sword-singer treats all attack tests made with Shehai\nShen She Ru that ties against a defender as having scored an\nadditional degree of success.\nThe Eighteen Hundred Defensive Positions\nType: Passive\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Novice)\nCost: 100 XP\nEffect: The sword-singer treats all defense tests made with Shehai\nShen She Ru that ties against an attacker as if the opponent\nfailed their test instead.\nThe Nearly Nine Thousand Moves\nType: Passive\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)\nCost: 200 XP\nEffect: Once per round, if the character fails an attack or defense\ntest made with Shehai Shen She Ru, they may reroll the test\n(but they must accept the new result).\nThe Ephemeral Feint\nBreathe in and then forget the breath; you cannot replace it until\nhe is down, to fight as if dead: second principle of pneumansu.\nType: Active (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)\nCost: 200 XP\nDifficulty: +0, with a -10 imposed for each activation of this\nability beyond the first per Long Rest.\nEffect: The character can activate this technique after being\nsuccessfully attacked by a melee, ranged, or bolt form spell attack.\nThis technique is activated as a free action before the character\ndeclares a defensive reaction. The character then immediately\nmakes a Shehai Shen She Ru test with the appropriate difficulty.\n201\n\fIf successful, the character reduces the DoS of the attackers\nattack roll by the DoS on the Shehai Shen She Ru test. If the\nattackers DoS are reduced to 0 or less, they count as having\nfailed their attack. The character can then choose to declare a\ndefensive reaction if they wish, as normal.\nThe Zero-Sum Interrupt\n(…) I would prefer to imagine that you could. It would mean\nthat I would bleed prior to the cut itself, bypassing all healing;\nmoreso, and this is what pleases me utmost… it would mean that\nI have indeed helped you.\nType: Active (Primary Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)\nCost: 400 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: Before the technique test, the character chooses a target\nwithin melee range. On success they may immediately make a\nstandard melee attack against the target as a free action, using\nthe results of their technique test in place of their attack test.\nFor the purposes of resolving this attack, the target does not\nbenefit from any Armour, Natural Toughness, or Resistances\nand the characters weapon gains the Magic quality.\nThe Havoc Canal\nCyrus moved to Havoc Canal, and Vivec nodded. Better. Your\nbuild favors that. But what if Ive enchanted my skin to harden\nat each instance?\nType: Active (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)\nCost: 300 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: This technique is activated as a free action before a melee\nattack. On the characters next successful standard melee attack\nthis turn they can choose a hit location for the attack. If the\nattack test succeeds with more than five degrees of success, the\ncharacter can immediately make another standard melee attack\nas a free action, which is automatically resolved against the\nchosen hit location. This second attack cannot be defended\nagainst but cannot gain advantages. These attacks are resolved\nsimultaneously, so any advantages from the initial attack do not\napply when resolving the bonus attack. This bonus attack does\nnot count against the usual limit of attacks per round.\nThe Tempest Attrition\nCyrus drew his saber, holding it left-handed in the Tempest\nAttrition. Vivec was impressed and said so. That stance allows\nyou a riposte, he said. Then he smiled again. If youre quick\nenough.\nType: Passive (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)\nCost: 300 XP\nEffect: This technique must be activated as a free action at the\nbeginning of a round and its effect remains until the end of that\nround. The character takes a -20 penalty to attack tests made\nwith Shehai Shen She Ru for the duration. In exchange they\ngain a +20 bonus on defense tests (including Counter Attacks)\nmade with Shehai Shen She Ru.\nThe Fingers-Knife\nThe Fingers-Knife serves as five, protecting your cardinal points\nand your central theory; five thrusts, spaced microseconds apart,\nlike tapping the desk bored, waiting for morning bread.\nType: Active (Primary Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Expert)\nCost: 500 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: Before the technique test, character chooses a target\nwithin melee range. On success the character may immediately\nmake a standard melee attack against target opponent as a free\naction, using the results of the technique test in place of the\nattack test. When resolving the attack, roll for damage five\ntimes and use the largest result. This does not stack with the\nProven Weapon Quality or the Savage Trait. The target of this\nattack may not attack the character until the beginning of his\n(the characters) next turn.\nThe Gaze of Confusion\nPaint fake eyes all over your face and then hide your real ones\namong them; the opponent can no longer read where you look.\nType: Passive (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)\nCost: 300 XP\nEffect: This technique must be activated at the beginning of a\nround and its effect remains until the end of that round. Other\ncharacters must pass a +0 Perception or Observe test in order\nto be able to perform a defensive reaction in response to the\nSword-Singers attacks.\n202\n\fThe Threat of Mirrors\nUsing the Math Athlete, you could occur several places during a\nsingle duel, illustrious and sure.\nType: Passive (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)\nCost: 400 XP\nEffect: This technique must be activated at the beginning of a\nround and its effect remains until the end of that round. Other\ncharacters must pass a Perception or Observe test with a -20\npenalty before being allowed make attacks or reactions against\nthe Sword-Singer each time they wish to do so. The Sword-Singer\nthen loses a Stamina Point when the effect ends.\nThe Vectoring Cygnet\nArm out, knee down, coal on the teeth to hide your smile.\nType: Active (Free Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)\nCost: 300 XP\nDifficulty: Variable\nEffect: This technique is activated as a free action, but only before\na standard melee attack. The sword-singer chooses the penalty\nof the test. The target of the characters next successful melee\nattack cannot react to that attack unless he passes a Perception or\nObserve test with a penalty equal to the penalty the swordsinger\nchose for the technique.\nThe Bone Shaver\nBellguard down, over, hold. Strike at 80 grams, any degree but\nthis one.\nType: Active (Primary Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)\nCost: 400 XP\nDifficulty: -10 per X\nEffect: The swordsinger selects a target in melee range and tests\nthis technique, choosing the penalty of the test. If successful, the\ncharacter can immediately make a melee attack against the target\nas a free action using Shehai Shen She Ru. The swordsinger can\nchoose the hit location freely. The targets wound threshold is\nreduced by X for the purposes of resolving this attack.\nThe Sword Tremor\nVivec spun in midair cross-legged, never moving his swordarm\nfrom its initial position. Fa-Nuit-Hen, the name of an old\nmaster, and Cyrus fell from eight wounds that appeared without\nmortal notice. Point down, blade edge forward, 60 degrees rise-\nwise from the ground.\nType: Active (Primary Action)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Master)\nCost: 800 XP\nDifficulty: -50\nEffect: Before the technique test, the character chooses a target\nwithin a number of meters equal to twice their Willpower bonus.\nThe Sword-Singer may immediately make a standard melee\nattack against that target as a free action (even if they are not\nengaged in melee).\nThe attack may not be defended against, and no characters can\nmake any other type of reaction to this attack.\nIf the initial attack is successful, the character may make another\nfree attack with the same conditions, although this attack cannot\ngain advantages and is made at a -20 penalty. These bonus attacks\ncan be repeated (each successful one prompting another) up to\na maximum number of bonus attacks equal to the swordsingers\nWillpower bonus. Each attack receives an additional, stacking\n-20 penalty (-20, then -40, then -60, and so forth). None of these\nattacks, including the first, can win Advantage. These bonus\nattacks do not count against the maximum attacks per round.\nWalled Consequence Stance\nCyrus merely nodded and lifted up, bandaged across his eight wounds,\nand the sugarcat hissed at the needless movement. Startled by the\nsound, the young ansu took a Walled Consequence stance.\nType: Active (Reaction)\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Expert)\nCost: 200 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: This technique may be activated as a reaction to another\ncharacters use of a Shehai technique directed at the character. On\nsuccess, the character may attempt a defensive reaction for free\nagainst an attack that would otherwise be impossible to defend\nagainst as a result of that technique. If the opponents Shehai\nShen She Ru technique allows them to make multiple attacks,\nthe swordsinger can make a defensive reaction to each of them\nfor free. Additionally, every successful defensive reaction made\nagainst an enemy Shehai users techniques forces the attacker\nto immediately lose one Stamina Point.\n203\n\fSword Tremor Sense\nWe know of you, Surahoon, and motions were multiplied the other\nmorning on this beach, which is sword tremor, which we can feel,\nand that can only mean you encountered the Ansu-Gurleth.\nType: Passive\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)\nCost: 300 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: The character gains the Unnatural Senses (Shehai\nTechniques, X) trait, where X is the characters Willpower bonus\nmultiplied by one thousand.\nThe Pankratosword\nBut this is forbidden. Arc the bones that otherwise cannot bend.\nType: Active\nRequires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Master)\nEffect: The Pankratosword does not require a test to use: if the\ncharacter has learned the technique, they may use it. Before\nthe technique is activated, the character chooses any target. is\nmay be something uncuttable, such as a place, thing, memory,\nconcept, and so forth. There are no practical limits to what may\nbe targeted with the Pankratosword. When the technique is\nactivated the character dies and the target is destroyed. Exactly\nwhat this means in practical terms is left to the GM, who should\nkeep in mind that the powers at work in any use of this technique\nare indescribably vast.\nTypically, no effect can allow a character to survive the use of this\ntechnique. However it is not impossible given the right mythic\ncircumstances (see the text Tiber Septims Sword-Meeting with\nCyrus the Restless). The GM can, in certain exceptional cases,\nallow a character to survive at great cost.\nImportant Note: The Pankratosword is the pinnacle of\nAberrant Swordsmanship: it is a forbidden technique\nthat allows a Sword-Singer to draw on pure Creatia,\nthe material of creation. It allows the Sword-Singer\nto bend the Earth-Bones themselves in order to alter\nreality, channeling pure energy through themselves as a\ncatalyst, ultimately enabling them to cut the uncutta-\nble. This technique is forbidden because its use resulted\nin the destruction of Yokuda, the ancient Redguard\nhomeland, and it has been lost ever since. Rules for\nthe pankratosword are provided here primarily as a\nguide and reference for the GM. The Pankratosword\nis not something that should be treated lightly. If either\nthe GM or the players were not familiar with Shehai\nbefore reading this section of this supplement, then they\nshouldnt be using it without first doing further research.\nShehai Talents\nThese talents enhance the characters use of the abilities granted\nto them by the Way of the Spirit Sword. In order to purchase\nor use any of these talents, a character must first possess the\nSword-Singer elite advance.\nAberrant Adept\nThe character is able to attempt the myriad techniques of\nAberrant Swordsmanship without tiring as easily.\nExpert (Willpower)\nThe character only ever loses one Stamina Point from failed\nTechnique tests.\nAnsei of the First Level (Weapon Type)\nThe character is able to manifest a barely visible, and relatively\nweak, spirit sword.\nAdept (Willpower)\nThe character chooses a weapon type when this talent is pur-\nchased (must be some kind of sword).

The\ncharacter may only ever purchase this talent once.\nAnsei of the Second Level (Weapon Type)\nThe character is able to manifest a spirit sword.\nExpert (Willpower)\nRequires Ansei of the First Level(Weapon Type)\nThe character may manifest a second level Shehai of the\nweapon type specified by the Ansei of the First Level talent.\nThe character may have up to 2 Shehai (Effect) talents. The\ncharacter may only ever purchase this talent once.\nAnsei of the Third Level (Weapon Type)\nThe character is able to manifest a  powerful spirit sword.\nMaster (Willpower)\nRequires Ansei of the Second Level(Weapon Type)\nThe character may manifest a third level Shehai of the weapon\ntype specified by the Ansei of the Second Level talent. The\ncharacter may have up to 3 Shehai (Effect) talents. The char-\nacter may only ever purchase this talent once.\nShehai (Effect)\nThe character can manifest a Shehai tuned to their own style.\nJourneyman (Willpower)\nWhen the character purchases this talent, choose one of the\nfollowing effects. This talent may be purchased multiple times,\nbut not with the same effect.\n                  Aberrant: Character gains a +10 bonus to technique tests \n\nwhen using the Shehai.\nRadiant:  The character can, as a free action, change the\ncomposition of their Shehai. When they do this, hits with\nthe Shehai count as sunlight.\nBurning: The character can, as a Secondary Cast Magic\n204\n\faction, change the composition of their Shehai. When they\ndo this, hits with the Shehai deal fire damage.\nConcussive: Characters Shehai gains the Concussive\nquality.\nElectrifying: The character can, as a Secondary Cast Magic\naction, change the composition of their Shehai. When they\ndo this, hits with the Shehai deal Shock damage.\nFreezing: The character can, as a Secondary Cast Magic\naction, change the composition of their Shehai.

When they do this, hits with\nthe Shehai deal poison damage.\nOur people once were artisans, poets, and scholars, but\nthe ever evolving strife made the way the sword inevitable\n\nthe song of the blade through the air, through flesh and\nbone, its ring against armor: an answer to our prayers.\n\n-Redguards, Their History, and Their Heroes\nThe Shehai\nThe Shehai, or Spirit Sword, is at the same time an integral part\nof sword-singing, and something separate from it. The Shehai\nis not needed for the techniques of Aberrant Swordsmanship,\nbut the same process used to shape the world through Aberrant\nSwordsmanship is used to manifest the Shehai. A sword-singer\nwho can manifest the Shehai is known as an Ansei, or Saint\nof the Sword.\nThe Shehai itself is an incorporeal weapon, ranging from a barely\ndefined misty shape, to a fantastical sword of pure thought. There\nare a total of three levels at which a Shehai may be manifested,\nand the form in which it manifests is shaped by its user.\nManifesting the Shehai\nIn game terms, the Shehai may be manifested in structured\ntime with the use of the Cast Magic Secondary action and a\nShehai Shen She Ru (WP) skill test, the difficulty of which will\nvary with the desired Shehai level. Characters must have the\nappropriate talent in order to manifest a Shehai of a given level.\nManifesting a Shehai of the First Level Requires: a Shehai\nShen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -10 penalty. Failing the\nmanifestation roll costs the Swordsinger a Stamina Point.\nManifesting a Shehai of the Second Level Requires: a Shehai\nShen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -30 penalty. Failing the\nmanifestation roll costs the Swordsinger two Stamina Points.\nManifesting a Shehai of the third Level Requires: a Shehai\nShen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -60 penalty. Failing\nthe manifestation roll costs the Swordsinger three Stamina\nPoints. On success, the character manifests the Shehai in\nan open hand. The weapon type of the manifested Shehai\nis determined in advance when the character purchases\nthe necessary talent. A Shehai persists until the character\ndismisses it, or for a number of hours equal to the characters\nWillpower bonus minus the level of the Shehai.\nA Shehai cannot be taken from the character in any way, and\nit may not be thrown without dissipating, as it is bound by his\nwill. The Shehai is transparent, but is very much capable of\ninteracting with physical objects: it can make attacks, applies all\nweapon qualities normally, and be defended against normally.\nShehai of the First Level\nA Shehai of this level may vaguely resemble a certain weapon,\nbut it is very weak. Use the base weapon profile for the chosen\nweapon type, but add half the characters unmodified (by spells,\nenchantments, alchemy, or any other sources) Willpower bonus\n(round up) to the  damage, and give the weapon the Magic and\nPrimitive qualities.\nShehai of the Second Level\nA Shehai of this level is clearly a weapon, and is quite potent.\nUse the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but add\nthe characters unmodified (by spells, enchantments, alchemy,\nor any other sources) Willpower bonus to the damage of the\nweapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.\nShehai of the Third Level\nA Shehai of this level is a legendary weapon of incredible power.\nUse the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but\nadd twice the characters unmodified (by spells, enchantments,\nalchemy, or any other sources) Willpower bonus to the damage\nof the weapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.\n205\n\fStorm Voice\nThe character, through talent and rigorous training, possesses the\nskill and power neccessary to wield the reality shaping powers of\nthe Thuum.\nCosts 1000 XP if a Nord or being trained, otherwise 1500 XP.\nThe character gains the ability to train the Thuum skill, learn\nWords of Power, and use them in Shouts.\nThe Thuum, also called the Storm Voice or simply the Voice, is\na form of magic inherent in most Nords and some others which\nuses the words of the language of the Dragons to form Shouts,\nthe equivalent of spells, of immense power. The word actually\nmeans shout in the Dragon language. The Nords believe that\nKyne, the embodiment of the wind who is viewed as the Nordic\naspect of Kynareth, breathed onto the land at the Throat of the\nWorld to form them. As such, the Nords believe that their voice\nand breath is their very essence, and that channeling this life\nessence is how the Thuum operates. Those who can wield this\npower are called Tongues by the Nords.\nSkill: Thuum (Wp)\nExample Specializations: Linguistics, War-Shouts, Lore\nThe Thuum skill reflects a characters potency of using their\nVoice, as well as their knowledge of the dragon tongue and their\nability to read and decipher draconic runes. Your GM may ask\nyou to test Thuum when:\nAttempting to understand or translate draconic runes and\nmarkings.\nAttempting to write in draconic script.\nAttempting to Shout.\nCharacters who have Dovahzul as a language alongside the\nThuum skill need not make a thuum test to speak, write or\nunderstand it.\nLearning Words of Power\nCharacters with the Thuum skill trained may unlock the ability\nto use a given word of power with XP assuming that they have\nsomehow learned the word of power during their adventures\n(meaning that the GM has control over which words the char-\nacter may access at any given time).\nThis represents the time spent to come to understand the nature\nof the word, and the practice required to be able to utilize it in\na Shout. Learning a given word of power without aid of some\nkind costs 200 XP times the level of the Word (for example, the\nfirst word in a Shout would be 200 XP, the second 400 XP, etc.).\nCharacters who have access to a guide (a teacher, an ancient text,\nor some other aid) during this process halve the cost.\ntrained in the Thuum skill, and have knowledge of a Word of\nPower. Words of power make up Shouts, which are similar to\nspells.\nCharacters may use Shouts with the Cast Magic Primary action.\nIt is important to note, however, that using a Shout as a Cast\nMagic action does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity.\nAdditionally, theres more to using the Thuum than just saying\na few words: Shouting requires concentration and power. Each\nShout has three words, and while speaking the first word is\nsufficient to produce an effect, each additional word adds more\npower to the Shout (but also requires more skill and energy to\nuse).\nOnce a character uses a Shout, they may not use that Shout\nagain until after a number of rounds equal to the number\nof words used in the Shout.\nShouting\nIn structured time, shouts are utilized with the Cast Magic\naction. The following steps detail exactly how to use shouts:\nStep 1: Choose Shout and Target\nFirst, the character must declare the shout being used (specifically\nthe number of words), and the target of the shout (if applicable).\nA character may only use a shout if they know the first word of\nthat shout, and they may only use further words if they know\nthose as well.\nStep 2: Make Thuum Test\nNext, the caster makes a Thuum skill test, the difficulty of\nwhich is determined by the shout the character has chosen. If\nthe character passes the test, they successfully manifest the shout.\nIf they fail, nothing happens. Either way, proceed to step 3.\nStep 3: Spend Stamina\nAttempting a shout takes a lot of energy, and the character is left\ndrained afterwards. Characters who attempt a shout must spend\none Stamina Point for each word used in the shout beyond the\nfirst. If a character fails a Shout, regardless of the number of\nwords in the Shout, they lose one Stamina Point.\nStep 4: Apply Effects\nIf the Thuum test was successful, apply the effects of the shout\nto the target as specified in the shout profile, and based on the\nnumber of words the character used.\nThuum Talents\nUsing the Thuum\nUsing the Thuum requires two things: the character must be\nAdept of the Voice\nThe character has gained substantial control over their Thuum.\n206\n\fAdept (Willpower)\nThe character is allowed to Test Endurance to not spend a\nStamina Point for the second word in a shout, but the third\nword still costs a Stamina Point to use.\nPrudent Voice\nThe character understands the power of understanding and\nrestraint, making him capable of using his Voice in more subtle\nways.\nExpert (Willpower)\nRequires: Adept of the Voice\nThe character can utilize his voice in subtle ways to affect\nthe world around him. By making a simple +0 Thuum test,\nthe Tongue can affect something that he can see within his\nWillpower Bonus in meters with any effect that could be\ncaused by one of the words he knows, like igniting something\neasily flammable by using the word for fire, Yol, or cause\nsomething small to move by using the word for force, Fus.\nWhat the tongue can and cannot do with this talent is up\nto the GM, but the effect is generally small and innocuous,\nthough it is still apparent to those nearby that the Tongue\nis using his Voice.\nMaster of the Voice\nThe character has gained total control over their Thuum.\nMaster (Willpower)\nRequires: Adept of the Voice\nThe character can now use the second word of a shout without\nspending a Stamina Point. Additionally, they may make a +0\nEndurance test to not spend a Stamina Point for the Third\nWord in a shout.\nVoice of the Ancients\nThe characters speech becomes too powerful for mortals to behold,\nas the world trembles under the power of his Voice.\nMaster (Willpower)\nRequires: Master of the Voice\nThrough meditating upon the true meaning of speech, the\ncharacters voice has become too powerful for mere mor-\ntals. Shouts that inflict damage add the Tongues WB to the\ndamage inflicted, and any shout that can be resisted adds a\n-10 penalty to doing so (after any modifiers chosen).\nAdditionally, the character can speak with their full voice\nto gain +20 on Intimidation tests made while doing so. In\ncombat, they can use a Secondary Action and 1 SP to force all\ncharacters who can hear them clearly to make an Endurance\ntest. Those who fail gain the Dazed condition until the end\nof their next turn.\nShouts\nThis section contains a number of shouts that characters\nwith the Voice may learn. Keep in mind that these are just\nsome of the ways that the Voice may be used, and no single\nlist can capture the true power and flexibility of this ancient\nart.  Players  and  GMs  are  encouraged  to  work  together\nto create their own shouts as they see fit, or to allow char-\nacters to utilize the Thuum skill in more creative ways.\nThe effects listed here are for the full sequence of words leading\nup to the chosen word, not just that word alone, though for\nsimplicitys sake we will refer to the individual words and not\nthe whole phrase.\nAll shouts are audible within a 50m radius or the affected radius,\nwhichever is larger.\nIf the shout is marked with the Whisper keyword, the Tongue\nmay choose to make the shout only audible within 1m instead.\nThe Attack keyword indicates that using the shout counts toward\nthe maximum number of attacks per round.\nAnimal Allegiance\nA shout for help from the beasts of the wild, who come to fight in\nyour defense.\nDifficulty: -10, -10 for each word beyond the first.\nR1N Raan : Animal\nCauses all creatures with the Bestial trait within 25 meters\nto come fighting for the character for one minute.

It uses the same testing functions of normal\nShouts, but costs triple the usual Stamina Points. Additionally,\nwhile a character is singing the Songs of Destiny Shout, they\ncannot use any other Shouts or speak normally and have their\nmaximum AP reduced by 1. If the character stops singing the\nSong for any reason, its effects end immediately.\nDifficulty: -20, -20 for each word beyond the first.\nPRODAH Prodah : Unavoidable Fate\nBefore rolling the Thuum test, the character must state an\nevent that will come to pass, like Today, we will taste vic-\ntory against the Dunmeri.

This includes any tests that attempt to\neffect something inside the area of effect, even if the source\nof the effect is not in that same area.\nD4N Daan : Prophecy\nSame as Prodah, except the penalty and bonus to tests both\nbecome 20. Additionally, those within the area of effect who\noppose the prophecy treat any skill check roll they make that\nis equal to one of the Tongues Lucky Numbers as a Critical\nFailure. Likewise, anyone seeking to fulfill the prophecy treats\nany skill check roll they make that is equal to one of the\nTongues Lucky Numbers as a Critical Success.\nM3R4D Miiraad : Choice\nSame as Daan, except the penalty and bonus both become\n30. Additionally, those within area of effect who oppose the\nprophecy treat any skill check roll they make that is equal to\none  of the Tongues Lucky or Unlucky Numbers as a Critical\nFailure. Likewise, anyone seeking to fulfill the prophecy treats\nany skill check roll they make that is equal to one of the\nTongues Lucky or Unlucky Numbers as a Critical Success.\nLastly, the Tongues grasp on destiny becomes so strong that\nanyone opposing the prophecy loses the ability to Burn Luck\nfor any reason other than to avoid death, and anyone seeking\nto fulfill the prophecy reduces the permanent reduction of the\nLuck characteristic by 1 (to a minimum of 1) when burning\nLuck.\n214\n\fHeroes of Sovngarde\nThe heroes of Sovngarde, ancient warrior spirits from the past, can\nbe commanded back to Mundus.\nHero of Sovngarde, Spirit, Major Solo, 1500 Black Soul\n*\nProficiencies\nAttributes\nChar\n\n\n\n\nStr\nEnd\nAg\nInt\nWp\nPrc\nPrs\nLuck\n50\n45\n45\n35\n50\n35\n40\n\n\n\nHP\nWT\nMP\nSP\nIR\nAP\nSpeed\nSize\n23\n14\n35\n5\n+10\n3\n13m\nMed\nCombat\nMagic\nEvade\nObserve\nStealth\nKnowledge\nSocial\nPhysical\n80\n80\n55\n55\n30\n30\n50\n80\nWeapons and Armor\nMay have one of:\n           Ancient Nordic War Axe: 1d8 Splitting; UW, 2m.\n          Ancient Nordic Broadsword: 1d8 Slashing, 2m.\n\nAncient Nordic Longbow: 1d8, Reload (2), UW,\n10/250/350m.

Both player and\nGM should work together to design an appropriate hero from\nthe ground up. Its suggested to make them like a PC, with the\nroughly the same XP total as the Tongue who commands him\nor her.\n215\n\fThuum Rituals\nThe Thuum is an ancient art, having seen many aspects rise and\nfall through the ages. While the Words of Power are the most well\nknown advantages of the Thuum, the Nords have discovered\nmany ways to impose their will upon the world with their Voice.\nListed below is a ritual, detailing how the ancient Tongues\ncould channel their Voice in a manner that has mostly become\nlost to time.\nThe Knotted Tongue (GRON SIK)\nIn the ages of old, Tongues would rip out the tongue of their greatest\nenemies, weave them into rope and imbue them with Speech. This\nwould result in a sinewy rope, known as a Gron-Sik, meaning to\nbind words, that would contain a part of the Tongues own breath,\ngiving it the power to Speak. Breathing life into the rope would\ngive it strength, and the Tongue would tie knots on it to contain\nthe breath within, unbinding a knot to unleash a part of its power.\nBut breathing life into the rope was costly, requiring a part of the\nTongues breath in order to stay alive.\nThe character then fills out the profile of the Gron-Sik\nby writing down the following information:\nThe chosen name for the Gron-Sik (Usually Gron-Sik of\nshout name).\nThe word(s) of the chosen shout imbued in the Gron-Sik.\nThe amount of DoS scored in the Imbuement, hence-\nforth known as Binding Strength.\nThe word Ties and a blank space in which to note a\nnumber.\nThe Gron-Sik can be activated with the Cast Magic action,\nspending one if its Ties to power all words of the shout, which\nautomatically counts as having succeeded with a number of DoS\nequal to its Binding Strength. If a shout requires an Opposed\nRoll, use the wielders Willpower Bonus.\nTo power the Gron-Sik, the Tongue must give it a Stamina Point\nfor each Tie desired. This can be done as part of a Long Rest,\nbut as long as the Stamina Points are Tied to the Gron-Sik, it\ncannot be recovered by any means, neither ordinary or magical.\nThe ritual allows the Tongue to imbue a ritually prepared rope\nof his enemies tongues with a part of his power, allowing him\nlimited use of his Voice, even if otherwise prevented from doing\nso, like being on the brink of exhaustion or somehow robbed\nof the ability to speak.\nCreating the Rope itself requires no test, but the creator must\nhave the tongues of three powerful and worthy foes, fresh\nHeartwood from a Spriggan (Extremely Rare Restoration ingre-\ndient) for smoking the meat, drying it out while giving it life,\nand Ice Wraith Essence (Very Rare Restoration / Destruction\ningredient) to preserve it from rot.\nWith the rope created, it must next imbued with one or more\nwords of power from a single non-Legendary shout that the\nTongue knows. Choose the desired Word(s) of the Shout and\nperform the appropriate Thuum test as if using that shout, but\nwith an added -10 penalty to each word beyond the first. If the\ntest is successful, the raconic runes representing the word(s)\nof the shout appear on the length of rope, indicating that the\nritual was a success. Regardless of the result of the test, all ritual\ningredients are consumed except for the tongue itself.\nExample\nGron-Sik of Fire Breath\n(Yol; Binding Strength 2; Ties [2])\nThe above is a tongue rope that can be activated two times\nbefore needing to be recharged, that when used performs the\nword Yol, the first word of Fire Breath, with 2 automatic DoS.\nWhos Tongues are Worthy?\nWhat makes a worthy foe is subjective. The best course of action\nis simply to ask the GM if an opponent would be considered\na worthy foe for the purpose of making a Gron-Sik, but as a\ngeneral rule of Thuum, a worthy foe is a challenging opponent,\noften one that has served as a minor antagonist or worse, such\nas the lieutenants of an enemy army, great monsters such as\ngiants or goblin kings, or most potently: other Tongues.\n216\n\fTales of Kinship\nThe Warden knows the secret stories of Yffres creatures, and can\nweave themselves to become a part of them.\nJourneyman (Willpower, Personality)\nRequires: Tale of  Tongues\nAny creature with the Bestial Trait that has been sufficiently\ncalmed by the use of the Profession[Animal Training] skill\nor through the use of Beast Tongue can, over the course of a\nLong Rest, become the target of a ritual. This ritual requires\n50 drakes worth of ritual ingredients and 30 Magicka Points\nto strike a bargain with the spirits of Yffres sacred beasts.\nAt the conclusion of the ritual, the Warden and the target\nmake an Opposed Willpower test. The Warden may spend an\nadditional 30 Magicka Points to gain an additional Degree\nof Success on their test as many times as they are able. If the\nWarden wins this opposed test they can learn the Call of\nNature(X) spell, where X is the targets creature type.\nTales of Brotherhood (X)\nThe Warden knows the ancient tales of Men, Mer and Beastfolk\nthat befriended the fiercest beasts of Yffre.\nExpert (Willpower, Personality)\nRequires: Tales of  Kinship\nThe Character deepens the bond between one of their oath-\nbound Beasts and themselves, turning it into a familiar. When\nthis Talent is purchased, choose one creature type (X) that you\nhave a bargain with. When the Warden summons this crea-\nture, they can choose to temporarily reduce their Maximum\nMagicka Pool by the Spell Cost for a number of days equal\nto their Personality Bonus. The familiar is summoned for as\nlong as the Wardens Magicka Pool is reduced in this way.\nIf the familiar dies before this effect ends, the Wardens\nMagicka Pool is restored. Only one familiar can be summoned\nat any given time.\nThis talent can be purchased multiple times for each creature\ntype (X).\nWArden\nThe character has become a Warden after devoting themselves to\nthe will of Yffre.\nCosts 750 XP if a Bosmer or being trained, otherwise 1000 XP.\nThe character gains the ability to train Conte Yffre &amp; Frostfall\nskills, learn and use Warden Spells and Talents.\nThe Tales of Yffre\nThe character gains the ability to train Conte Yffre &amp; Frostfall\nskills, learn and use Warden Spells and Talents.\nSkill: Conte Yffre (Willpower, Personality)\nExample Specializations: Bears, Cliff Racers, Familiar\nStriking pacts with beasts and plants alike, the Warden tells tales\nof natures warmth and compassion, its capacity for growth, or\nthe wrath of nature scorned.\nYour GM may ask you to test Conte Yffre when:\nAttempting to convey your intent to an animal.\nAttempting to gauge the state of nature around you.\nAttempting to use Conte Yffre spells or talents.\nSkill: Conte Frostfall (Willpower, Personality)\nExample Specializations: Same as Spell origin schools\nEmbodying the Frostfall, the Wardens tale unleashes the wrath\nof harsh winter; frost, blizzards and decay upon foes. Characters\ncan utilize the Conte Frostfall (using Willpower or Personality)\nas if it were the relevant Magic School skill when casting or\npurchasing Conventional Spells with the [Frost] Attribute, or\nwhich deals Frost based damage.\nAny talent that can affect the original spell still functions as if\nit was cast with the original School.\nWarden Talents\nThese talents enhances the characters use of the abilities granted\nto them by the Conte. In order to purchase or use any of these\ntalents, a character must first possess the Warden Elite Advance.\nTale of Tongues\nThe Warden knows the ancient tales of the secret tongues of birds\nand words of wolves.\nApprentice (Willpower, Personality)\nBy spending 5 Magicka, the Character can use the Beast Tongue\nRacial Ability of the Bosmer for a number of minutes equal to\ntheir Prs Bonus. If the character is a Bosmer they can use this\ntalent at the same cost to ignore the Perception test to speak\nwith unfamiliar animals entirely. The talent can be used this\nway before or after the test.\n217\n\fTales of the Wild Hunt\nThe Warden has been bestowed the tale of ancient times where\nmonsters were truly wild, unconstrained by the Green Pact, and\ncan empower his familiar with this power.\nMaster (Willpower, Personality)\nRequires: Tales of  Brotherhood (X)\nThe Characters Familiar summoned with the Tales of\nBrotherhood may gain the Wild Shape Racial Ability of the\nBosmer: The Unglamoured on page 37, the effects of which\nare chosen upon the summoning of the Familiar. Additionally,\nthe familiar gains the Magic quality on all attacks with its\nnatural weapons. Lastly, if the familiar perishes from injury,\nthe Warden can spend a Stamina Point and pay the cost of\nsummoning the Familiar to magically restore it to full health.\nThis can only be done once for each time the familiar is\nsummoned.\nFrozen Gate\nThe Warden tells the tales of people who went into the raging snow\nof the Frostfall, never to be seen again.\nJourneyman (Willpower, Personality)\nThe Warden can test Conte Frostfall(+0) and spend 20 Magicka\nusing a Cast Magic Secondary Action to create a portal of ice\nunderneath a target character within 25 meters, causing the\ntarget to immediately appear on the ground before the caster\nwithin 3 meters. If a valid location is unavailable the effect fails\nautomatically. On a successful cast, the Warden rolls Willpower\nopposed by the Targets Evade or Athletics skill if they want to\navoid it. This counts as a 4th Level Spell.\nSecluded Grove\nThrough Yffre, nature provides a sanctuary in which the Warden\nand their allies can rest deeply or in safety.\nAdept (Willpower, Personality)\nThe Warden can choose to invoke the natures spirits to\nprovide comfort or safety, within the confines of a small\nnatural area. Calling upon this boon costs 5 Magicka for a Short\nrest and 15 Magicka for a long rest, spent upon completion of\nthe rest.\nChoose one of the following:\nComfort: The Warden and their allies double the effects\ngained from a Long or Short rest taken in the defined\narea. A character can choose to forgo this benefit to\ninstead treat a single Wound of the characters choice.\nSafety: The Warden and their allies will not be disturbed\nby any wildlife with the Bestial trait during their sleep.\nAdditionally, they count as if they had the Light Sleeper\nTalent. If they already have this talent, they instead gain\na +20 bonus to their Observe test for the purposes of\nnoticing potential threats.\nConte Yffre Spells\nThis section contains a number of spells for the Conte Yffre\nskill that Wardens may learn through their innate connection\nwith Yffre, Lord of the Wild.\nThese spells have no associated individual spell effects and, as\nsuch, cannot be used for enchantments, unconventional spells,\nor alchemy.\nNew Spell Attribute: Natural\nOnly targets standing on a surface that could sustain natural life\nin some capacity, such as a forest floor, a dirt road, or a riverbed,\ncan be affected by this spell.\nCall of Nature\n… they surged forth, the savage wolves making short work of the\npoachers and bring peace once more!\nUpkeep, Mindlock (Spell Strength)\nSummoned Creature\nLevel Cost\nSpell Strength\nMudcrab\nCave Rat\nSlaughterfish\nDog\nHorker\nWolf\nGiant Bat\nGiant Snake\nHorse\nDurzog\nGiant Spider\nLion\nCrocodile\nDreugh / Land Dreugh\nBear\nOgre\nCave Troll\nGiant\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n5\n5\n6\n6\n6\n7\n3\n4\n4\n6\n8\n8\n10\n10\n11\n11\n12\n12\n14\n15\n17\n18\n22\n30\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\nSummons a bestial creature with the Summoned and Bound\ntraits, which appears within five meters of the caster.

The target makes a +0 Wp test to\nresist the effect. If this test is successful, they become aware\nthat theyve been affected by some kind of magic. If they\nfail, they become affected by a level 4 Charm Spell Effect.\nAundae: Dark Magic of the Mind\nThe gaze of the Aundae can invoke a primal fear and mad-\nness  from  their  enemies.  As  a  Primary  Attack  Action,\nthe  vampire  can  cause  a  target  within  15m  to  either\nmake a +0 Horror test. Alternatively, they can cause the\ntarget to test Wp, gaining the Frenzied Trait on a failure.\nQuarra: Might of the Grave\nAs a Secondary Action, the vampire may spend 1 SP to\ngain +2 to their strength bonus and increase the damage die\nof their natural weapons by one dice step  for 10 minutes.\nBerne: Embrace of Shadows\nWhile in Dim light or Darkness, the vampire may turn invisible until\nthey attack, cast a spell, or come within 3m of a bright light source.\nVolkihar: Freezing Breath\nWhile grappling a target, the vampire may breathe into them\nas a Primary Attack Action, freezing them from within. The\ntarget takes 1d6 Frost damage and must make a +10 Endurance\ntest, becoming Paralyzed on failure. On a success, they are only\naffected by the Slowed trait for 1 hour.

Additionally, the target suffers a -20 to the\nWp test to resist. The vampire may also select a single target for\nthis ability to affect indefinitely until the vampire releases them\nat will. Each time the indefinite target of the power is damaged\nthey can re-test their roll to resist.\nDarkness of the Subconscious\nYour mind is naked to me! I can taste your fear!

Doing so imposes\nMindlock(1) for as long as the corpse remains animated or until\nthe vampire chooses to end the effect. If the duration would end,\nthe vampire may spend 1 SP and 1 AP to instead maintain it\nfor another 3 rounds. When the effect ends or the reanimated\ncorpse dies, they dissipate into a pile of ash.\n220\n\fmaster by being targeted by a successful level 4 or higher Dispel\neffect or through the death of their master.\nRite of Sanguine Preservation\nVampires proficient in this process can create blood potions to\nsustain themselves when fresh prey is scarce. Creating a potion\nof blood  requires a clean phial made of pure crystal, a cutting\nimplement, a rare Restoration ingredient, a creature with a\nblack soul as a source for blood, and the knowledge of the\nprocedure itself.\nThe target must either be helpless or a willing participant for\nthe duration of this 5 minute process. The vampire first must\nextract the blood from the victim into the crystal phial, dealing\nthe chosen cutting implements base damage which bypasses any\nAR and reduces the targets Endurance by 10 until after their\nnext Long Rest. Then, the rare restoration ingredient must be\nskillfully mixed with the blood by passing an alchemy test as\nif this were a level 4 potion. See Step 4 for creating potions on\npage 148. If the test fails, then the blood spoils and the phial\nmust be cleaned before making another attempt. In either case,\nthe used restoration ingredient is consumed.\nWhen consumed, the blood within this phial sates the vampires\nthirst for a day.\nRite of Undeath: Death Hound\nVampires who are proficient in necromancy can uncover the\nsecret of the creation of the Death Hound. This ritual follows\nthe base rules for the Rite of Undeath on page 150, with the\nfollowing rules for specifically the Death Hound:\nDeath Hounds require 75 Magicka to raise, and require 30\nminutes of ritual time. A Death Hound requires a wolf sized\nbody though it doesnt necessarily need to be a wolf. A large cat\nor other hound will work just fine. A Death hound must have\nits body intact, cannot have died with an unhealed wound, and\nmust be properly prepared. Then, the blood of a vampire must\nbe somehow introduced into the corpses body.\nA character can raise multiple Death Hounds at once as a pack,\nadding +25 Magicka and requiring a fully prepared corpse for\neach additional Death Hound. Every five Death Hounds added\nin this way imposes a -10 on the Necromancy test to perform\nthe ritual.\nSupernatural Reflexes\nYou have unlocked the ability to move at such a speed and with\nsuch precision that few can act before your fangs are sunken in\ntheir throats.\nMaster (Agility)\nThe vampire improves their Initiative Rating by 2, gains a +10\nbonus to all Evade tests, and increases their movement speed by 2.\nUndead Fortitude\nYou have come to realize that your organs are little more than a\nrelic from older days.\nAdept (Endurance)\nThe vampire either gains the Tough (1) trait or increases their\nexisting Tough trait by 1. Additionally, they either gain the\nResilient (2) trait or increase their Resilient trait by 2.\nVampiric Secrets\nThe rules contained within this section represent secrets held by\npowerful vampires. They cannot be purchased with XP  instead,\nthey must be learned from the few people or tomes who contain\nthis forbidden knowledge.\nRituals\nEnthralling Rite\nVampires who practice this rite are able to turn unwilling prey\ninto devout servants through the power of profane blood magic.\nThis ritual requires no components except for a cutting imple-\nment and knowledge of the rite itself.\nFirst, the target of the ritual must be restrained in some fashion\nfor the duration of the 10 minute ritual. Then, using a cutting\nimplement of their choice, the vampire must slice themselves,\ndealing the appropriate damage from the item used to make\nthe cut, which bypasses AR.\nThen they must forcefully feed their blood to the target over the\ncourse of the remainder of the ritual. For the next ten minutes,\nthe vampire and their potential thrall are locked in a battle of\nwills as the vampire chants daedric rites of domination and sub-\nservience. The two must each make an extended Willpower test,\nmaking each individual test simultaneously. The first character\nto reach 15 DoS wins this battle of wills. If the vampire wins the\ntest, the target of the ritual successfully becomes the vampires\nthrall; otherwise, the target becomes immune to this ritual for\n1 week. A vampire can keep a number of thralls in their service\nequal to their WB.\nA vampire thrall willingly and enthusiastically follows the com-\nmands of their master. However, for as long as they are enthralled,\ntheir Intelligence is halved and the vampire should give them\ndirect and specific instructions lest they misinterpret the intent\nof their masters words. A thrall is freed from the will of their\n221\n\fVampiric Spellcasting\nThere are two forms of vampiric spellcasting; Nox Arcana and\nHemomancy. They do not follow the same rules as standard\nspellcasting, but are still activated using Cast Magic actions.\nOnly vampires have a connection to the daedric energies\nrequired to cast these spells.\nTo learn the skill associated with either requires that the char-\nacter have the Child of the Night Elite Advance and gain the\nknowledge from a tome or vampire who has knowledge of them,\nwhich grants them the skill at rank 0 (Novice). From there, the\nskill can be advanced as normal with XP - however, only one\nmay be advanced to rank 5 (Master).\nLearning a legendary spell from either doctrine requires that\nthe vampire has the associated skill trained to rank 5 (Master).\nNox Arcana (Wp)\nCommonly called night magic, Nox Arcana is an ancient power\nthat few vampires still have in recent generations.\nGaining one of the Nox Arcana spells below requires that the\nvampire feed on the blood of another vampire and spend 100 XP.\nUsing a Nox Arcana spell requires that the vampire pass a Nox\nArcana skill test. Any associated SP cost is not spent on a failure.\nShrouding Mist\nCost: 1 AP + 1 SP\nCasting Time: 5 minutes\nThe vampire calls upon the eternal darkness to cause the sur-\nrounding area in a 2 kilometer radius to be consumed by a\nheavy fog. This imposes a -10 penalty to all Observe tests and\nany vampire within the area has their Dawn-Cursed trait value\nreduced by 1 for as long as the fog remains. The fog lasts for\n5 hours and cannot be ended early unless affected by a more\npowerful magic.\nBat Form\nCost: 1 AP + 1 SP\nThe Vampire becomes a swarm of bats. They gain the Flyer (10)\ntrait, change their size to Tiny (-20 to hit by larger characters or\nat range), and reduce their max HP to 5. The effect ends after\n3 rounds unless the character spends 1 SP, which refreshes the\neffect for another 3 rounds. The spell ends immediately and\nthe vampire reverts to their true form if the HP is reduced to 0.\nNight Cloak\nCost: 2 AP + 1 SP\nThe vampire summons a swarm of bats which inflicts 1d6 Poison\ndamage to all hostile creatures in a 2m radius at the end of each\nof the vampires next 3 turns, starting on the current turn. The\nvampire then regains an amount of health equal to the total\ndamage dealt after mitigation.\nEclipse\nLegendary\nCost: 3 SP\nOver the course of 30 minutes, the vampire calls upon the\npowers of domination to eclipse the sun, limiting exposure to its\nsearing light. The surrounding area within 8 km of the vampire\nis shaded from the sun, and vampires within it are unaffected\nby their Dawn-Cursed trait for the next 2 hours.\nBlack Shadow\nLegendary\nCost: 1 AP + 2 SP\nThe vampires shadow becomes disconnected from them while\nthis spell is active. The detached shadow gains the stats of a\nGloom Wraith and acts as a summoned creature, doing the\nvampires bidding. The Gloom Wraith stays summoned for 5\nrounds, which can be refreshed for 2 SP. It also rolls its own\ninitiative and acts independently in combat. If the Gloom\nWraiths HP is reduced to 0 or becomes unsummoned, it is\nreattached to the vampire as their shadow.\nHemomancy (Wp)\nBlood magic is a profane art known only to the most vile vampiric\nsorcerers.\nUsing a Hemomancy spell requires that the vampire pass a\nHemomancy skill test. Regardless of the result, the full MP\nand AP cost is spent. Hemomancy spells cannot benefit from\nspell restraint.\nVampiric Drain\nCost: 1 AP + 11 MP\nThe vampire drains 2d6 magic damage to a target within 4m,\nrestoring their own HP by the amount of damage successfully\ndealt (after any reduction). If this kills the target, the vampires\nthirst is sated for the day. If this spell is affected by a reflect spell\nor effect, it has no net effect.\nBlood Grasp\nCost: 1 AP + 10 MP\nThe vampire forces a target within a 15m range to make a -10\nStr test. On a failure, the vampire can force the target to move\nup to 10m closer to them. This forced movement can trigger\nAttacks of Opportunity.\nSanguine Shield\nCost: 2 AP + 15 MP\nThe vampire creates a sanguine dome with a 3m radius centered\non themself, protecting any character encompassed within.\nThe dome has 30 HP and any source of damage targeting a\ncharacter within it damages the dome instead. The dome has\nthe Sun-Scarred (5) trait and cannot regain health by any means.\n222\n\fCrimson Sphere\nLegendary\nCost: 3 AP + 20 MP\nThe vampire creates a 2m radius sphere made of blood which\nenvelopes them, restoring 2d8 HP each round that they remain\nin the sphere. The sphere lasts for 3 rounds, has 50 HP, and\ntakes all damage which targets the sphere or a character within\nit. If the sphere comes into contact with Sunlight or is dealt\ndamage which counts as sunlight, it is immediately destroyed.\nConsuming Blast\nLegendary\nCost: 1 AP + 16 MP\nThe vampire launches a bolt of vampiric energy to a point within\n20m which explodes in a 3m radius, dealing 2d8 magic damage\nto those caught in the Area of Effect. The vampire regains HP\nequal to the damage dealt (after any reduction). If a target is\nkilled as a result, the vampires thirst is sated for the day.\nVAmPire lord\nMantle of the Lord\nThe vampire spends 2 AP  to assume the mantle of the vampire\nlord. Their body morphs and strengthens; sprouting wings and\ntwisting the face into the visage of a monstrous humanoid\nbat. When they assume this mantle, all who see the grotesque\ntransformation must make a Panic test. The vampire can revert\nback to their normal form at will.\nThe Vampire Lord Form\nWhile in their mantled form, the character gains the following:\nNatural Weapons (Fangs, 1d12 Splitting, Magic)\nFlyer (3)\n+1 max SP\nRegain 10 HP and increase max HP by 10\nUnarmed and Bite attacks gain the Exploit Weakness\nQuality\nNatural Toughness (4)\nVampire Lord Talents\nCharacters with the Vampire Lord elite advance may purchase\nthe talents in this section.\nYour blood is pure; whether you were sired by Molag Bal himself\nor consumed the blood of an existing Vampire lord matters not.

Additionally,\nthe requirement for a dispel effect to free their thralls is increased\nto a 6+ level Dispel effect.\nThe vampire can now see through the eyes and hear through\nthe ears of their thralls whenever they wish, and their thralls no\nlonger suffer the Int penalty involved with their enthrallment.\n223\n\fBeASt Within\nYou have given in to the beast who lurks within, seeing it more as\na blessing than a curse. This pleases Hircine.\nMust be a Lycanthrope\nCosts 750 XP if youve been taken under an experienced\nlycanthropes wing, otherwise 1000 XP\nLycanthropes who take this elite advance immediately gain the\nfollowing benefits:\n+10 to Wp tests related to transforming into and out of\nbeast form\nSavage trait in beast form\nIncrease Bestial Intinct Skill by 1\nDepending on the characters lycanthropy strain,  they also\ngain one of the following:\nWerewolf: Unnatural Senses (Smell, 3) in normal form,\nand Unnatural Senses (Smell, 6) in beast form\nWereboar: Tough (3) in both forms\nWerebear: Vicious (SB + 2) in both forms\nTalents\nLycanthropes who take the Beast Within Elite Advance have\naccess to purchase the talents in this section.\nGorging Feast\nDo not allow a single morsel of flesh to go wasted on your kills.

Shadow mages can potentially\nchange the past, present, and future in this way. Shadow Magic\nis most common around the border of Hammerfell, Skyrim and\nHigh Rock, and is rarely seen elsewhere.\nBecoming a Shadow Mage\nIn  order  to  purchase  any  Shadow  Magic  talents,  have  a\nConvergence Rating, or utilize Congruence Powers or Rituals,\na character must have the Shadow Mage elite advance. Becoming\na Shadow Mage is a difficult and grueling endeavor, but once this\njourney is completed, the character gains access to possibilities\nthat exist beyond the ordinary understanding of magicto\nwield the power of shadows and transcend the boundaries of\nlight and darkness.\nThe path to becoming a Shadow Mage requires completing a\nritual that binds the character to the shadows. This ritual not only\nopens their soul to shadow magic but also shapes the way they\nwield it, tying their power to one of three governing attributes:\nIntelligence, Perception, or Personality. These attributes reflect\nthe unique approach and philosophy the character adopts in\ntheir mastery of shadow magic. These rituals are extremely rare\nand difficult to find. They are not common knowledge, and are\ngenerally only known to those who have undertaken the rituals\nthemselves. Once found, learning and comprehending these\nrituals requires that the character pass a -20 lore test which, if\nfailed, can be reattempted the following day.\nEach of these rituals asks the character to make a test against\nthemselves. This is achieved by the player making their own test\nwhile the GM makes a test using the same target number in\nsecret. The two results are compared and resolved as a normal\nopposed test, and the opposed test is rerolled in the case of a\ntie. This test represents the struggle between the character and\ntheir alternate selves to complete the goal of the specific ritual.\nOnce a ritual is successfully completed, the character gains the\nConvergence Rating (1) trait.\n225\n\fThe Rite of Secret Knowledge\nThe Rite of Secret Knowledge demands both intellectual rigor\nand a willingness to endure isolation from a prospective shadow\nmage. They must withdraw from all distractions, entering a\nstate of solitary contemplation for one uninterrupted week.\nDuring this time, they create a unique booka vessel for their\nunderstanding of shadow magic.\nIn order to begin this ritual, the character must craft an obsidian\ntome with meticulous care. Doing so requires the use of paper,\npolished obsidian for the cover, and the hair of a creature with a\nblack soul to bind the pages to the cover. Then, the prospective\nshadow mage must mix a small amount of their own blood into\na pot of ink, a process that deals 1 damage to the character, to\ncreate the ink required to continue with this ritual. The material\ncosts for these items are difficult to calculate, as  some of these\ncomponents are not commonly available and may need to be\nharvested or found out in the world. However, once these items\nhave been acquired, binding the pages onto the cover to create\nthe book is not complex, but it is rather time-consuming. From\nstart to finish, the process takes 8 hours of active work for the\nfirst time. For any subsequent times the character crafts this\nbook, the duration required to complete this task is halved.\nContrary to the process of bookbinding, conducting the ritual\nitself  is far from straightforward. While the prospective shadow\nmage crafts their book, so do their shadows in an unknowable\nnumber. As such, the book is not a static creation  it is a conduit\nlinking the character to alternate versions of their prospective\nselves linked by the shadows. Over the course of this rituals\nduration, the character  must scribe their knowledge into the\nbook - an offering to their shadows - while obfuscating it and\nattempting to glean additional knowledge from the dark san-\nguine ink that appears magically on the obsidian tomes pages.\nEach shadow attempts to obfuscate their own  knowledge while\nsolving the riddles and overly-complex formulas entered into\nthese pages by their alternates.\nAt the culmination of seven gruelling days of competitive study,\nthe character must make an Opposed Intelligence test against\nthemselves. If the character fails, the book is claimed by a shadow\nand is lost by the character completely.\nFailure is not without its lessons, however; the prospective\nshadow mage gains a cumulative +10 bonus (only applied to\nthe players character) to the opposed test of their next attempt.\nOnce the character succeeds, they triumph over their alternates\nand can finally claim the book for themselves. By doing so, they\ncomplete the Rite of Secret Knowledge and gain the Shadow\nMagic Elite Advance using Intelligence as its governing char-\nacteristic once they spend the required XP.\nRite of Penumbric Insight\nProspective Shadow Mages seeking to wield the power of the\nshadows through the use of their Perception must find a site of\ngreat conflict. This place must be the epicenter of some great\ncalamity, turmoil, or tragedy. Before they begin this ritual, the\ncharacter must ritually prepare their body by receiving a perma-\nnent marking of an eye with obsidian dust as the main material.\nThis eye must be at least the size of the characters own eyes.\nThey must also come prepared with some sort of mind-altering\nsubstance which would alter or expand their perception of reality.\nOnce the prospective Shadow Mage arrives at their chosen\nlocation with the required materials for this ritual, they must\nchoose a serene location at the site, imbibe the hallucinogen,\nand remain within the chosen location for the next 7 harrowing\ndays. Over the course of this duration, the character will witness\noccurrences surrounding and leading up to the event associated\nwith this site. The character must peer into and beyond these\noccurrences with the aid of the hallucinogen, attempting to\nwitness alternate versions thereof. For example, at the site of\na betrayal, the character might witness cooperation against a\ncommon foe instead. During this time, the character eats and\ntakes rests as normal.\nAt the culmination of this seven day ritual, the character must\nmake an opposed Perception test against themselves. On a failure,\nthe marking of the eye which the character used for this ritual is\nstill visible, but permanently closes. However, failure improves\nthe characters ability to peer into the shadows of this place. They\ncan begin the next attempt at this ritual with a cumulative +10\nbonus (which only applies to the player characters test) for the\nopposed test on the next attempt.\nOnce they succeed, the character has gained the ability to peer\ninto the shadows beyond those of their own realm without\nalchemical assistance. As a result, they gain the Shadow Magic\nElite Advance using Perception as its governing characteristic\nonce they spend the required XP.\nRite of Dark Conspiracy\nThe Rite of Dark Conspiracy asks much of the prospective\nShadow Mages force of character. Completing it requires that\nthe character choose and bring with them an object, character,\nor creature of great importance to them as a tribute. Additionally,\nthey must prepare the ritual space, which must be a place of\ntotal isolation, by setting up a circle of obsidian mirrors.\nWhen the character is ready to begin the ritual, they must sit at\nthe center of this circle and perform a sacrifice of their chosen\ntribute. Deep within the reflections of the obsidian mirrors,\nthe character witnesses the same and similar events occurring\nnearly infinitely before them. Then, over the course of 8 hours,\nthe character and their shadows enter into intense negotiations\n226\n\fto determine which of them deserves the power granted by this\nritual.\nAt the culmination of this 8 hours, the character must make\nan opposed Personality test against themselves. On a failure,\nthe mirrors fade to black, returning the character to total isola-\ntion without having achieved their goal. However, this failure\nimproves the characters ability to reason with themselves, which\ngrants them a cumulative +10 bonus (which only applies to the\nplayer characters test) for the opposed test on their next attempt.\nOn a success, each of the infinite shadows that participated in\nthis ritual grants them an inconsequential portion of them-\nselves, combining to great effect. This grants the character the\nShadow Magic Elite Advance with Personality as their Governing\nCharacteristic once they spend the required XP.\nNew Trait: Convergence Rating (X)\nA character with this trait has the ability to converge alternate\nrealities to change their own world through the use of Shadow\nMagic. The X value of the trait, which ranges from 1-10, rep-\nresents their raw ability to do so.\nConvergence Rating (CR) is the measure of a characters raw\nability to manipulate shadow: the higher their CR the more\npowerful they will be. CR is measured on a scale of 1-10, and\nis represented by the Convergence Rating (X) trait. CR plays an\nimportant role in the use of Congruence Powers and Congruence\nRituals, both abilities that manipulate shadows in order to\nproduce certain effects.\nCongruence Abilities\nCongruence Powers are the result of a shadow mage twisting\nshadows in order to affect the forces that created them.\nCongruence Rituals are similar to Congruence Powers, but they\nrequire more preparation and focus to utilize. Neither Powers\nor Rituals require magicka.\nShadow Magic is based entirely within the characters governing\ncharacteristic, which was determined by which ritual granted\nthem the ability. Shadow mages who use their Intelligence can\nintellectually deduce reality down to the circumstances they want\nto occur with such pristine precision that the shadows have no\nchoice but to obey. Those who use their Perception have the\nability to perceive between the cracks of their own universe and\nuse or pull out the shadows and alternate occurrences that they\ndesire. Lastly, those who use their Personality have the guile to\nconvince the shadows to do their bidding.\nUsing Congruence Abilities\nWhen utilizing either Congruence Powers or Rituals, the shadow\nmagician will partition their raw ability to dedicate a portion\nof their power to the power or ritual.\nTo cast a power or perform a ritual, first, the character must\ndecide how much of their Congruence Rating they are commit-\nting (a whole number above 0), then they will roll the Governing\nCharacteristic (GC)  granted by their initiation ritual with a\ncertain bonus or penalty specified by the power or ritual.\nFor each point lower the chosen CR is than their maximum CR,\nthe character receives a +10 bonus to their GC test. For each\npoint higher the chosen CR is than their max CR, the character\nreceives a -10 penalty to their GC test.\nIf the character uses less CR than their maximum and passes\nthe test, then the power or ritual succeeds. If, under the same\ncircumstance, they fail the test, then the power or ritual fails\nand the character suffers a Minor Disharmony. If the character\nuses more CR than their maximum, and passes the test, then\nthe power or ritual succeeds and they automatically trigger a\nMinor Disharmony. If, under the same circumstance, they fail\nthe test, then the power or ritual fails and they automatically\ntrigger a Major Disharmony.\nIf the character critically succeeds while making their shadow\ncasting test, no disharmonies are triggered regardless of CR\nexpenditure. However, if they critically fail, they trigger a major\ndisharmony.\nIf the character is using a congruence power or performing a\ncongruence ritual by thought alone, the congruence test suf-\nfers a -20 penalty. Using a congruence power or performing a\ncongruence ritual with only one hand imposes a -10 penalty\non the power or ritual test. If the character is performing the\npower or ritual without any hand motions, the power or ritual\ntest suffers a -20 penalty.\nCongruence Powers\nA character can only use Congruence Powers that they have\nlearned. Any character with a Convergence Rating of one or\nhigher can learn powers by spending the XP listed with the\npower. While Congruence Powers are considered magic, they do\nnot count as spells when considered by other effects, including\ntraits or talents.\nEach power has a default difficulty associated with it. This bonus/\npenalty is used on top of the characters bonus when committing\nCR. For some powers, the default difficulty is also a formula\nbased on the duration of the power, which is another variable\nchosen by the caster when the power is used.\n227\n\fShadow Armor\nThe character cloaks themselves with the myriad possibilities of the\nshadow, making it more difficult to land a substantial hit on them.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -10 - (5X)\nEffect: The character chooses a duration X. During this time,\nattack tests made against the character suffer a -5CR penalty.\nThis effect lasts for X rounds.\nShadow Drain\nThe character uses translocation techniques to siphon essence from\nthe target into themselves.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: +0 - (5 * X)\nEffect: Character chooses a range X. Target character within up\nto (X * 5) meters takes 2 * CR Shadow damage instantly, and\nthe character heals for the same amount.\nShadow Meld\nThe character merges themselves with pieces of themselves from\nanother reality, enhancing some of their abilities.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: The character increases a chosen characteristic score by\nX, where X is five times the CR of the power. This effect lasts\nfor 1 round.\nShadow Sight\nThe character opens their eyes to the secrets of the shadows around\nthem, augmenting their perception.\nCost: 50 XP\nDifficulty: +20 - (5 * X)\nEffect: The character chooses a duration X. They can see through\nshadows, effectively meaning they can see through solid objects.\nThey also gain the Unnatural Senses (Life, Y) trait where N\nis equal to the CR of the power times 10. This effect lasts X\nminutes.\nActivating a Congruence power requires that the character have\nboth hands free. For each hand that is not free, the character\nsuffers a -20 penalty to the Shadow Magic test. Talents which\nlower these requirements for spellcasting apply to activating\ncongruence powers as well.\nBlink\nThe character reaches into the shadows, using them to speed their\njourney through their currents.\nCost: 100 XP\nDifficulty: +0\nEffect: The character vanishes and reappears at a target loca-\ntion within up to (CR*5) meters of their starting location. The\ncharacter must be able to see their target location.\nForeboding\nThe character is connected to the shadows around them, allowing\nthem to see danger coming.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: As a secondary action, when the character uses this\npower, the next successful attack made against them has its\nDoS reduced by the CR committed when this power was used.\nIf this would reduce the attackers degrees of success to zero or\nlower, the attacker counts as having failed the attack test. This\neffect lasts until the characters next long rest.\nVanish\nThe character hides themselves in the shadows.\nCost: 50 XP\nDifficulty: +10\nEffect: The character gains the Invisible condition for a number\nof rounds equal to the CR of the power. The condition is lost if\nthe character attacks, casts a spell, or activates a power.\nMirror Image\nThe character twists the shadows around them, presenting multiple\nimages of themselves to others.\nCost: 100 XP\nDifficulty: +10 - (10 * X)\nEffect: The character creates an illusory duplicate of themselves.\nThe duplicate emerges from within the character, persists for\nX minutes, and may be controlled as a free action, though it\nmoves as normal. It may not move more than CR kilometers\naway from the character and cannot attack targets or interact\nphysically with objects or the environment. Other characters\nmust pass a Perception test with a -5 penalty for each CR in\norder to determine which of the two images is real (they must\nonly make this test when first encountering the duplicate and the\noriginal together). The character can see through the duplicates\neyes, hear through its ears, and speak using its mouth.\n228\n\fShadow Weapon\nThe character bends the shadows to their will, forming a fearsome\ndark weapon.\nCost: 100 XP\nDifficulty: -10 - (5 * X)\nEffect: Character chooses a duration X. Summons a weapon\nwith the type of the casters choice, using the Penumbric weapon\nmaterial specified below to complete the profile. If the weapon\nleaves the characters reach, it vanishes. The weapon may be dis-\nmissed by the character at will. The item persists for X minutes,\nor until the character who summoned it is killed. Weapons\nsummoned using this power always count as being part of the\ncharacters combat style.\nThe penumbric weapon material has a +3 Material Bonus. When\nresolving Slashing, Splitting, or Crushing with a penumbric\nweapon the CR of the power is used instead of the characters Str\nbonus. The bonus damage granted from these weapon qualities\nand from the material bonus is resolved as Shadow damage.\nSummon Shadow Horror\nThe character brings forth a creature that lives in the shadows, born\nfrom the myriad forces that shape them.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: +0\nEffect: Character chooses a duration X. Summons a weapon\nwith the type of the casters choice, using the Penumbric weapon\nmaterial specified below to complete the profile. If the weapon\nleaves the characters reach, it vanishes. The weapon may be dis-\nmissed by the character at will. The item persists for X minutes,\nor until the character who summoned it is killed. Weapons\nsummoned using this power always count as being part of the\ncharacters combat style.\nA Shadow Horror (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement)\nappears within five meters of the caster with the Summoned trait.\nIt must obey the commands of the character while it is in this\nplane. The creature persists for 1 minute, or until the character\nwho summoned it dies, and then vanishes. Alternatively, the\ncharacter can choose to simply unleash the Shadow Horror. The\nShadow Horror appears within five meters of the caster: it does\nnot obey the characters commands and is hostile to all characters.\nThe Shadow Horror must immediately make an Opposed\nWillpower test with the caster. If the caster wins the test, the\nShadow Horror has the Bound trait. If the Shadow Horror\nwins the test, they are not Bound to the caster. During the\nOpposed Willpower test, the caster gains a 5*CR bonus to the\nroll. Keeping the Shadow Horror in line imposes Mindlock (3).\nTwist Fortune\nThe character turns the shadows against their target, and they work\nsubtly to foil their every action.\nCost: 50 XP\nDifficulty: +10\nEffect: The character chooses a single target within (20 times\nCR) meters. If the target fails the opposed test, he is plagued by\nmisfortune for CR rounds: constantly tripping over themselves,\nand generally fumbling in everything they do. The exact effects\nare left to the GM.\nCongruence Rituals\nA character can only use Congruence Rituals that they have\nlearned. Any character with a Convergence Rating of one\nor higher can learn rituals by spending XP or CrP. While\nCongruence Rituals may be magic, they do not count as rituals\nfor the purposes of other effects.\nEach ritual has a Default Difficulty associated with it. This\nbonus/penalty is used on top of the characters bonus when\ncommitting CR.\nBind Shadow Weapon (30 Minutes)\nThe character bends the shadows to their will, transforming a\nweapon into a fearsome dark implement and binding it to their\nshadows.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -30\nEffect: The character binds a physical weapon to their shadow.\nThey target a specific physical (not summoned) weapon and\neither themself or a willing creature, binding the weapon to\nthe target character. When the ritual is completed, the physical\nform of the weapon slips into the target characters shadow, no\nlonger existing in its physical form. The target character can\nnow summon and unsummon this weapon as a free action at\nwill. While summoned, the weapon has the same profile it had\nbefore it was bound to the character including any modifications\nand enchantments; however, damage from weapon qualities and\nthe material bonus is applied as Shadow damage. A character\ncannot have more than one weapon bound to them in this way.\nIf the target character already has a weapon bound to them,\nthen that weapon ceases to exist and is replaced by the new\nweapon from this ritual.\n229\n\fShadow Portal (10 Hours)\nThe character shapes the shadows so that he may pass through their\nrealms in an instant to cross great distances.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -20, with an additional -20 penalty if the desired\ndestination is in another plane or dimension.\nEffect: Creates a portal, within 5 meters of the character, which\ntunnels through the shadows to target location (the location\ncan be anywhere the character has visited before, as long as they\ncan clearly picture it in their mind).\nWhen the first character passes through the portal, the character\nwho created it must make an Intelligence test, the difficulty of\nwhich is determined by the GM based on how long it has been\nsince the character was at the target location, how far away\nthe location is, his state of mind when the portal was created,\nother circumstances, and so forth. If he passes this test, then the\ncharacter (and any subsequent ones) who passes through this\nportal arrives at the desired destination instantly. On failure, the\nGM may choose an alternate destination (the nature of which\nis left to their discretion). The character makes this test at a +5\nbonus for each CR.\nAnyone passing through the portal must make a Willpower\ntest with a -20 penalty or suffer a minor disharmony when\nthey emerge (adding their degrees of failure to the result on the\ntable). The portal persists for 5 minutes, or until the character\nwho created it closes it (which may be done at will, instantly).\nShadow Scry (5 Minutes)\nThe character peers through the shadows themselves, casting his\ngaze across the world.\nCost: 50 XP\nDifficulty: -10\nEffect: The character sees events currently happening somewhere\nelse: the higher the CR the more the character can control what\nthe vision centers on, and the more detail they receive from the\nvision. The vision lasts a number of seconds equal to three times\nthe CR of the ritual. This counts as visiting a location for\nthe purposes of choosing a target for the Shadow Portal power.\nPrecognition (30 Minutes)\nThe character can see the reflection of future events amongst the\nforces that shape the shadows around them.\nCost: 50 XP\nDifficulty: +0\nEffect: The character sees a vision of their own future hidden\nwithin the shadows. This vision lasts a number of seconds equal\nto twice the CR of the ritual. The character can look up to CR\ndays into their own future while this effect is active. The higher\nthe CR, the more the character is able to control what these\nvisions focus on (up to GM discretion).\nShadow Gate (1 Hour)\nThe character binds the shadows, securing an object from prying\neyes and the fingers of thieves.\nCost: 75 XP\nDifficulty: -20\nEffect: The character creates an impenetrable shadow gate which\nsecures a target door, chest, or other container or portal. This\nshadow gate lasts forever, and can only be opened by a shadow\nkey or by the character that created it (with a free action). CR\ncannot be dedicated to this ritual.\nShadow Double (8 Hours)\nThe character forcibly moves an alternate version of someone from\nanother reality to this one. The party in question is usually not\nhappy with this arrangement.\nCost: 300 XP\nDifficulty: -30, with an additional -20 penalty if the target is\nanother character.\nEffect: The character being doubled must be chosen as the\nritual focus, and thus must take part in the ritual. The character\nperforming the ritual can choose to double themselves. Forcibly\npulls an alternate version of the target character into this reality\nwith none of their belongings or equipment,. The higher the\nCR, the less divergent from this realitys version of the character\nthe alternate version will be. The exact nature of this character\nis left entirely to the GM. The GM has complete control over\ntheir actions, unless he deems that the character is an exact or\nnear exact duplicate of one of the PCs, in which case the player\nin question may control themselves and their double.\nThe double enters the world in a pure black shadow state\n(though they are fully physical) and slowly gains color and detail\nover an hour as they adapt to this plane. Characters exposed to\nalternate versions of themselves must make a fear test with a\n+20 bonus, and an additional -5 penalty for each CR above 4:\nthe more exact the duplicate, the more Traumatizing the effect.\nIf the character performing the ritual is duplicating themselves,\nthey are exempt from this requirement. If the alternate version\nof the character dies, they return to their realm reset to the\nstate they were in when they were removed from it.\n230\n\fShadow Sense\nThe character has picked up the habit of monitoring the currents of\nthe shadows around them, and is able to detect when theyre being\nmanipulated.\nJourneyman (Prc)\nThe character can make an Observe skill test in order to detect\nwhen other characters use congruence powers or rituals within a\nnumber of kilometers equal to the X value of their Convergence\nRating (X) trait. On success, their degrees of success determine\nhow accurately they can place the location of the other shadow\nmage and determine the nature of the power used.\nHarmonic Safeguards\nThe character is able to fetter their power in such a way as to entirely\nprotect himself from Disharmony.\nAdept (EA Governing Char.)\nIf the character dedicates less than or equal to half their maxi-\nmum CR (round up), then they cannot trigger Disharmonies\nin any way.\nShadow Walk (10 Minutes)\nThe character walks through the myriad alternate realities that exist\nwithin the shadows, entering one of them.\nCost: 100 XP\nDifficulty: -20, with an additional -20 penalty to send another\ncharacter.\nEffect: The character performing the ritual is the focus for this\nritual. The target character shadow walks to an alternate reality.\nTheir physical body vanishes from this world, and appears in\nanother. Given the infinite number of possible realities, choosing\none specifically is quite rather, as most are indistinguishable. The\ncharacter using the ritual may specify the nature of the target\nreality, and the higher the CR of the ritual the more accurately\ntheyre able to choose the reality they enter.\nIf the character fails the test with degrees of failure less than or\nequal to their Willpower bonus, the ritual still manifests: the\nGM should adjust the effective CR of the ritual (-1 for each\ndegree of failure) and then determine the effects based on this\nnew CR. The character does not know that they erred in any\nway. Failure with degrees of failure in excess of their Willpower\nbonus means the ritual simply does not manifest its effects.\nThe only way for a character to return to their original reality\nis to use this ritual to get back, though a CR of 4 is sufficient\nto send the character home due to their connection to their\noriginal realm.\nIf this ritual is targeting a character other than the caster, the\ntarget character must be either willing or helpless.\nTalents\nShadow Magic talents improve a characters ability to manipulate\nthe shadows through the use of shadow magic.\nSublime Congruence\nThe character improves their connection to the shadows around\nthem, manipulating them for their own gain.\nVaries (EA Governing Char.)\nThe character increases the X value of their Convergence Rating\n(X) trait by one. The character can purchase this talent more\nthan once. This talent begins at the Novice level, and gains a\nlevel each time a character purchases it, to a maximum of Master.\nThis talent can be purchased more than once at the master level,\nto a maximum Convergence Rating value of ten.\n231\n\fResult\nMinor Disharmonies\nEffect\n1-3\n4-5\n6-8\n9-11\n12-14\n15-17\n18-20\n21-23\n24-26\n27-29\n30-32\n33-35\n36-38\n39-41\n42-44\n45-47\n48-50\n51-53\n54-56\n57-59\n60-62\n63-65\n66-68\n69-71\n72-74\n75+\nFor the next 10 minutes, all characters seem to see figures, resembling people, lurking in the shadows in the area\naround the character.\nFor the briefest of moments, all shadows within 50 meters disappear completely, only to return a few seconds later.\nA shadow bends around the character, coiling around him like a snake, for 1d4 minutes.\nAll people within 50 meters feel a shiver run down their spine.\nAll animals within 100 meters take on a sinister look and begin to behave erratically for 1d4 minutes as shadows\nflock to them.\nA single random object within 2d10 meters of the character disappears only to be replaced with something from\nanother reality. The trade is completely random, and left to the GM to determine.\nAll people within line of sight of the character have a trivial memory torn from them forever.\nFood and plants within 25 meters begin to rapidly rot away.\nAll lights within 50 meters go out, smothered by shadows.\nFor a brief moment (one round), it seems to everyone within 30 meters of the character that night has fallen,\nplunging the area into total darkness.\nMirrors and windows within 25 meters of the character show strange, rippling visions of alternate worlds.\nEveryone in sight, including the character, feels a terrible pain in their chest. They gain the stunned condition for\n1 round.\nThe characters features take on a dark appearance, as the shadows contort his visage into that of a monster. He\ngains the Frightening (-10) trait until the end of the next round.\nThe character vanishes, only to reappear moments later (at the end of the next round) from within a random\nshadow within 50 meters of his starting position.\nEveryone within sight, including the character, loses a Stamina point and notices that their bodies seem to be\ncasting more shadows than they should for the next minute.\nShadows begin to bleed from the walls and well up from the ground within 15 meters of the character. If there are\npaintings or statues of people, they appear to be crying shadows. All who witness this must make a Panic test.\nThe shadows lash out against the disharmony, and all people within sight of the character, including the character\nhimself, must pass an Agility test or be knocked prone.\nSmothering shadows fill the air, cloaking the area within 30 meters in total darkness for 1d4 rounds. The character\nis thrown 1d10 meters into the air in a random direction by tendrils of shadow.\nShadowing apparitions fill the air within 15 meters of the character, wailing as if tormented. All people witnessing\nthis must make a Panic test with a -10 penalty.\nPitch black rifts open in the air within 10 meters of the character, lifting everyone into the air and threatening\nto swallow them into whatever dark dimension they lead to, only to vanish seconds later. Everyone affected falls\n1d10 meters.\nShadows contort violently around the character, releasing a deafening shriek that can be heard up to a kilometer\naway. This shriek shatters glass, and forces everyone to make an Endurance test or become deafened for 1d10\nrounds.\nThe characters own shadow grabs him and thrashes him around violently for 1d4 rounds, he must make an\nEndurance test or lose 1d4 Stamina Points.\nFor a split second the world changes appearance, and everyone within 50 meters gets a glimpse of the countless\nterrifying realities that lie beyond the veil of shadows. All affected characters must make a Panic test with a -20\npenalty.\nAll light sources, magical or otherwise, within 50 meters go out. No light can penetrate the area within 15 meters\nof the character for 1d10 rounds.\nAll characters within 20 meters, excluding the character, gain the Frenzied condition as their alternate selves bleed\nthrough from beyond the veil of shadows.\nThe character causes a major disharmony: roll on the major-disharmony table (adding the CR of the power).\n232\n\fResult\n1-6\n7-10\n11-14\n15-19\n20-25\n26-31\nMajor Disharmonies\nEffect\nThe characters shadow begins to scream as visions of uncountable realities flash before the characters eyes only to be forgot-\nten a moment later. The character must make a Panic (-20) test.\nBaleful shadows course through the character, inflicting torment upon him. The character must make an Endurance test or\ngain the stunned condition for DoF rounds.\nVisions of alternate realities bleed through into this one. The characters friends and foes appear to them to be terrible\nmonsters of shadow. The effect lasts 1d4 rounds and they must make a Panic test with a -30 penalty.\nA specter of darkness appears, cursing the character for his hubris, and strikes him down with ice cold tendrils of shadow. He\ntakes 1d10 frost damage to a random hit location.\nThe character completely loses control of the shadows around him, and they lash out at his mind. He cannot use any other\ncongruence powers for the next 1d4 hours.\nThe characters mind is whisked away to another reality, leaving them unconscious. At the beginning of each round they may\ntest Willpower to attempt to return to reality, but if they fail with degrees of failure beyond their Willpower bonus, his mind\nis lost forever.\n32-39\nThe character winks out of this reality and re-appears 2d4 minutes later.

Redirect the power that caused this Disharmony\nagainst the character. If such a thing isnt possible, the character takes 1d8 damage to a random hit location, bypassing armor,\nnatural toughness, and resistances.\nDark beings appear from all shadows within 20 meters, whispering the unfathomable secrets of other realities to anyone\nunlucky enough to hear them. Everyone affected must make a Horror (+0) test.\nA random person within 50 meters is suddenly swapped with another version of themselves from an alternate reality. This\neffect only ends when the intruder is slain, or after five minutes when the original returns (though the double might still be\naround!). The character returns with the dazed condition for 1d10 rounds.\nA wild and dangerous Shadow Horror (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) pops into existence within 15 meters of\nthe character, and persists for 1 minute  or until it is slain. It detests the character, and will attack him whenever possible.\nAll characters within 50 meters take 2d6 damage that ignores armor, natural toughness, and resistances as they are assaulted\nby their own shadows.\nAll shadows within 25 meters reveal their true forms, showing the myriad possibilities of other realities. All characters\nwitnessing this must make a Horror (-20) test.

All shadow magic powers used in the area\nautomatically cause a minor disharmony.\nThe character blinks out of existence for 1 round, returning with none of his belongings, and a broken mess of a body. He\ntakes 2d6 damage that ignores armor, and appears to have suffered years of torture. He is mentally and physically scarred by\nthe ordeal.\nEach character within 100 meters suffers from a distorted perception of reality, as shadows shift and present false visions, or\nvisions of another world, to them. Each round for 2d10 rounds, everyone affected must make a Willpower test or succumb\nto this new reality. What this entails is left to the GM.\nA Sliver of UmbraKeth (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) appears within 30 meters of the character. Its sole\npurpose is to kill the character or be destroyed in the attempt.\nThe character sinks into the darkness of their own shadow until they are completely gone. Once inside whatever alternate\nreality they have been pulled into, they must make a test using their shadow magic Governing Characteristic with a -50\npenalty. On success, they have a chance to find their way back, though this takes time (either play a short session for the\nplayer later, or simply rule that they return after 3d10 days, battered and bruised). On failure they are lost forever.\nThe characters own shadow is destroyed, and the shock from losing his link in the middle of manipulating the innumerable\nshadow realms kills him instantly.\nA Sliver of UmbraKeth (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) appears where the character once was, destroying him\ninstantly as it explodes from his shadow.

No two\nShadow Horrors appear completely identical, often appearing\nas a horrific mixture of monstrous traits melded together into a\nshadowy, almost incorporeal form. No matter their exact form,\nthey are truly dangerous abominations that can kill even the\nmost experienced Shadow Magicians.\nShadow Horrors do not appear naturally on Tamriel and GMs\nshould consider whether-or-not they truly belong at their table\nbefore introducing them. If there is no connection between your\ncampaign and Shadow Magic, it is likely best to leave them out\nof things. These creatures can only enter the Mundus via two\nways; as a summon for a Shadow Magician or as part of some\naccident caused by a Shadow Magician. They are strong and have\naccess to powerful abilities, meaning that only well-equipped\nand experienced parties can deal with them effectively.\nLoot\nUpon defeat the Shadow Horror is banished back to\nthe realm-between-realms from whence it came, leaving\nbehind a viscous inky-black residue where it fell.

It took the form of a tall, bipedal, tentacled\ncreature with a trunk like a mammoth. Referring to itself as\nthe Shadow of Conflict, it was ultimately defeated by a hero\nremembered as the Soul of Conflict by utilizing the legendary\nStar Teeth. Its ultimate goals were unknown, but its influence\ncast a dark shadow over parts of Hammerfell, Skyrim, and\nHigh Rock.\nWhen it was defeated, it was shattered into many Slivers, each\npossessing a fragment of UmbraKeths vast power. These slivers\nnow haunt the realms-between-realms, preying upon any shadow\nmages powerful enough to attract their attention.\nA Sliver of UmbraKeth is one of the most powerful creatures\nthis system provides for; only Dragons are more deadly. Caution\nshould be taken by any GM looking to use these eldritch horrors.\nA Sliver of UmbraKeth should only be encountered when a\nShadow Mage suffers the appropriate Major Disharmony or\nas a final, greatest foe in a campaign as their powerful abilities\ncan make short work of even the most powerful adventurers.\n235\n\fLoot\nUpon defeat the Sliver of UmbraKeth is banished back\nto the realm-between-realms from whence it came, leav-\ning behind a viscous inky-black residue where it fell.

The affected creature must make a Willpower test with a [Spell Strength] modifier to resist the effect otherwise the creature is returned to the last location it inhabited on it’s home plane. If the spell is cast on a creature that is already native to the plane that it currently resides in then the spell has no effect. This spell can also be used to end the reanimation on a necromancers thrall, however in this case the Necromancer tests Willpower instead of the thrall.\nClairvoyance\n“A handy spell for scatterbrained mages who tend to lose their keys or daedric artefacts”\nDirect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels1234567Cost8162432404856Spell Strength1005001000300010’000100’0001’000’000\nThis spell allows the caster to find a person or object if it is located within a [Spell Strength] meter radius of the caster. If the goal is outside the spell radius the spell fails and the magicka for it is consumed. The same applies if the Person or Object is in a different plane of existence than the Caster (Plane of Oblivion or Aetherius if the Caster is on Mundus). A faintly glowing blue line will lead the caster to the target of the spell and persists until the goal is reached or the Caster dismisses the Spell. The blue line will follow the shortest possible path to the goal that isn’t physically blocked. Only the caster can see said blue line.\nThe caster has to be very familiar with the person or object to cast the spell without penalty otherwise the following penalties to the casting test apply:\nInteracted with Object or Person once for a short time: -10\nSeen Object or Person once for a short time: -15\nHas detailed description from someone who is very familiar with Object or Person: -20\nHas somewhat accurate description of Object or Person: -30\nHas vague description of Object or Person: -40\nOnly knows the Name of Object or Person: -50\nExtremely powerful or mystical Items or People can only be located with a seventh level Clairvoyance spell. Examples include Daedric Artefacts, Elder Scrolls, Ancient Magical Balls of DoomTM, disappeared Heroes or legendary Magelords.\nThe spell also fails if its target is too vague to be considered a concrete Object or Person in the casters mind. Searching for “incriminating evidence” or “person who knows a lot about dragons” for example will cause the spell to fail. The GM has final say on what is concrete enough to fall within the spells capabilities. If the Person or Object is has a “Dispel” spell of the same level as the Clairvoyance spell cast on it, the Clairvoyance spell will be dispelled.\nCounterspell\n“No you dont!”\nDirect, Reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels1234567Cost8162432404856Spell Strength1234567\nAs a reaction the caster can try to interrupt a spell being cast by another spellcaster within 50m that he can see. Both casters use the DoS of their casting tests to determine whether the spell can be interrupted. Ties are always resolved in favour of the initial caster (and not the person casting counterspell). If the spell is successfully interrupted the caster loses the MP for that spell (but it is treated as successfully cast for the purpose of using spell restraint). If the spell being interrupted is at a higher level than counterspell, the casting test is at -10 per higher level (so a level 1 counterspell interrupting a 2nd level spell is cast at -10 and a level 1 counterspell interrupting 4th level spell is at -30 etc.). A third party caster can attempt to counterspell the counterspell, but the caster being interrupted cannot. This spell cannot be used to interrupt the upkeep of an already cast spell.\nVision of the Tenth Eye\n“When you really need to see more than meets the eye”\nUpkeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels1234567Cost481216202428Spell Strength251015202530\nThe caster projects a small (ca. 2cm∅) ball of arcane energy up to [Spell Strength] meters away from themself for 1 minute. The caster can see through the ball as if it were their own eyes. The ball can’t pass through solid objects and can’t move anything it touches.
