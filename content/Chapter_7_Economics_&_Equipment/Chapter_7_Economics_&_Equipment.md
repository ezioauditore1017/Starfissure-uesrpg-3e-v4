# Chapter 7: Economics & Equipment

So many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. Its a very sad state of affairs, 
when the game is really open to all, you dont need an invitation. And it is a game, the game of bargaining, to be 
played seriously and, I hasten to add, politely.

The Buying Game

 
In a normal day, a plethora of goods flows through Tamriels 

markets. Tamriels many thriving economies have resulted in a 
continent linked through trade and commerce. There are a vast 
number of goods and services produced by these systems that 
characters might need to survive, or might encounter, during 
their adventures. This chapter is concerned with the economics 
of the Elder Scrolls setting, as well as detailing the various items 
players use or buy.

Currency
The main currency of Tamriel in the time during and after the 
Septim Empire is the Septim, a golden coin around the size 
of a quarter. Named after the dynasty that ruled the Septim 
Empire, it features a bust of Tiber Septim and a depiction of 
Akatosh. The inscription on the front reads, The Empire is Law. 
The Law is Sacred. And the reverse reads:, Praise be, Akatosh 
and all the Divines. Although many provinces issue their own 
provincial currencies these can all be converted to Septims. If 
you are running a campaign in an era before the Septim Empire, 
simply use an alternative name (such as Remans). And while 
we have no information on the way that the Empire handles 
its monetary policy, the authors are making the assumption 
that there are different types or denominations of currency in 
existence within the empire. In game terms, this means a few 
things:

 

 

             This Chapter will use the more Era-neutral word Drakes 
for currency. Gold is an acceptable substitute, though 
the authors would prefer not to assume that every coin 
actually contains gold.
   Coins have no in-game weight unless the GM decides a 
character is simply carrying too much money to ignore. 
This is done for simplicity.
           Rather than making players keep track of the different kinds 
of coins they have, it should be assumed that characters 
can carry as much money as they want, simply making use 
of more and more valuable denominations.
           Likewise, it should be assumed that there are enough coins 
of the various denominations floating around that indi-
viduals can always complete transactions accurately and 
receive change.

 

In short, dont worry about how many of which types of coins 
youre carrying. Just keep track of how many Drakes you have. 
This is to save time and accounting for both the players and 
the GM.

For groups that enjoy this sort of thing, it is easy to convert the 
system into one based around different types of coins. Simply 
use the value of a single Drake as the base for the lowest value 
coin and scale things up by multiples of ten for more valuable 
coins as you see fit. 

priCinG & aCquiSition

Not all prices for one item are going to be the same: regional 
price variations are to be expected. Some things are simply 
harder to get a hold of in some places and easier in others. 
Additionally, item price will vary drastically with the quality of 
the item itself. We have intentionally left item rarity up to 
the Game Master for the majority of items in this section. 
These guidelines should help the GM produce prices that are 
acceptable for game-play purposes. 

A Note on Rounding
If an item ever ends up with a fractional price for any reason, 
simply round up to the nearest whole number.

Availability & Cost Modifiers
In order to locate an item for sale, a character must make a 
Commerce or Investigate test. The difficulty of the test should 
be determined by the specific item the character is looking for. 
The GM should use their judgment and lore knowledge in equal 
measure when making their decision. The following table can 
provide some guidelines:

Availability Modifiers

Item Availability Modifier

Uncommon

Average

Ordinary

Common

Plentiful

Ubiquitous

-40

-30

-20

-10

-

+10

+20

+30

Item Quality Level
Items can also vary drastically in quality based on how well 
they were made or some feature inherent to the item. This 
will modify their price and their availability. There are three 
quality levels for most items: inferior, common, and superior. 
Exactly what measurable impact this has on the item (if any) 
will be explained in the appropriate section (Weapon Quality 
and Armor and Shield Quality sections later in this chapter).

before going for the bargain, roll a Commerce Test with a mod-
ifier equal to the items rarity (see Availability Modifiers on page 
108) to see if they can learn the current rates. 
On a success, the character gains a +10 bonus to their attempt 
at haggling.
On a failure however, add a -5 penalty per Degree of Failure 
to their attempt at haggling, as they have misinterpreted the 
current trend of the market.

Location Modifiers
While Tamriel has a flourishing international market due to the 
many merchant guilds dotting the continent, certain objects 
must be imported or accessed through more illegitimate means.
The following table can provides some guidelines for any such 
availability and pricing modifiers:

tium outside High

Haggling for a Bargain
Bargaining is a part of everyday life and almost expected amongst 
professional merchants.
Should a character wish to bargain with a merchant for the 
price of their wares, roll an opposed Commerce Test against 
the merchant.
For every Degree of Success the character scores above the 
merchant, a 5% discount is gained.
If the merchant wins the Commerce test, increase the price by 
5% per Degree of Success instead.
A character can always choose to not accept a bad bargain, but 
a local market is a living, breathing thing and word travels fast 
about bad customers.
Should a character deny a bargain and go elsewhere, the GM 
can choose to apply a penalty equal to the % of the bargain 
that was denied.

Unscrupulous Traders
Certain merchants can be particularly unscrupulous in their 
bargaining, either due to holding a monopoly on a certain 
ware or being a position that allows them to press their hapless 
victim for an extra fee like a fence giving less for stolen goods, 
well knowing that the prospective seller has nowhere else to go.
When bargaining with such unscrupulous types, the GM can 
choose to apply a penalty ranging from -10 to -40 to the char-
acters Commerce Test when bargaining for a better price on 
their goods.

Appraising an Item
Not knowing the current market value of certain goods has 
been the bane of many a haggler.
If a character wishes to assert the price of an object of interest

weaponS

Conflict and danger are constants in Tamriel, and it is wise 
for adventurers to arm themselves. Weapons in UESRPG are 
divided in a number of different ways. First, there are two classes 
of weapons: melee and ranged. All weapons are defined by a 
Weapon Profile, which contains all the information necessary 
to use the weapon. 

Weapon Qualities
Many weapons possess special rules, known as Weapon 
Qualities, that represent factors that set them apart from other 
weapons in some fashion.

The Big Three
Below are the three most important weapon qualities. Most 
weapons posses one of these qualities, which are critical to their 
identity. Their effects can stack on instances of themselves or 
with one another.

Crushing (X)
Weapons with this quality can crush metal and bone alike. They 
deal bonus damage equal to the wielders Strength bonus (or X, 
if another value is given), capped at the AR of the hit location 
or BR of a shield used to block it.

Splitting (X)
Weapons with this quality can deal savage wounds when properly 
brought to bear. They deal bonus damage equal to the wielders 
Strength bonus (or X, if another value is given), but only if the 
initial damage result causes the target to lose 1 or more HP.

Slashing (X)
Weapons with this quality tear flesh with ease, dealing extra 
damage equal to the wielders Strength bonus (or X, if another 
value is given) against unarmored hit locations.

Other Weapon Qualities
Listed below are many of the other qualities weapons may have. 
It is important to be familiar with the qualities your weapons 
possess and how they interact with one another!

Complex
A character cannot move on a turn that they are reloading this 
weapon.

Concussive
The weapon causes heavy impacts and can send opponents 
sprawling. When a character triggers the bash special action 
after gaining advantage with this weapon, they gain a +20 bonus 
to the opposed test.

Damaged (X)
Weapons with this quality deal X less damage. If this would 
ever render a character incapable of dealing damage with the 
weapon, even with the maximum possible roll, then the weapon 
is destroyed. Natural Weapons cannot receive this Quality. All 
instances of this quality stack.

Dueling Weapon
Weapons with this quality add an additional degree of success 
to successful tests made to parry or Counter-Attack with them.

Entangling
Attacks with this weapon cannot be parried or blocked. Instead 
of dealing damage, a successful attack with this weapon forces 
the opponent to make a Strength or Agility test. If they fail, they 
gain the Entangled (page 111) condition. They can spend 1 
AP as a Secondary Action to repeat the test, freeing themselves 
and removing the condition on a success. 

If this effect was applied by a melee attack, then should the 
target character leave the melee range of the Entangling weapon, 
the character wielding the weapon must choose to either let go 
of their weapon (maintaining the effect on the target) or keep 
their weapon (removing the effect from the target).

Focus
Character treats the hand holding the weapon as a free hand 
for the purposes of casting spells. The weapon does not increase 
the range of any spell as a result of its reach.

Exploit Weakness
These weapons are small and able to slip into gaps in a targets 
defenses. Attacks with this weapon treat full armor as partial 
armor and partial armor as unarmored (but do not actually 
reduce the locations AR). This can be used to trigger effects, 
such as Slashing, that interact with the level of armor the target 
is wearing.

Flail
Weapons of this type are able to strike unpredictably. These 
weapons cannot be parried or countered, but cannot be used to 
parry or Counter-Attack either. If an attacker with this weapon 
and a defender blocking with a shield both pass their respective 
tests and the attackers degrees of success exceed those of the 
defender, then the defender does not block the attack as they 
normally would, and the attack is resolved as if the attacker 
had won. If a character critically fails an attack with a flail they 
hit themselves.

171

Impaling
If this weapon is used to make an attack of opportunity 
against a character who is approaching the wielder, and 
that attack causes the target to lose HP, the target does not 
advance and instead halts their movement for the turn. 

Hand to Hand
This weapon can be used with Unarmed Combat Style and 
counts as Unarmed for the purposes of resolving damage. 
Additionally, the wielder can perform actions that require an 
open hand while wielding these weapons at a -10 penalty.

Hooked
This weapon has a hook that can be used to trip and yank 
opponents and their weapons. Attempts to defend against the 
characters Disarm, Take Weapon & Trip Special Actions is 
done at a -10 penalty.

Magic
Weapons with this quality are able to harm targets that would 
otherwise resist or be impervious to damage from normal weap-
ons, such as ghosts. 

Mounted
Weapons with this quality can only be used while mounted due 
to their weight and balance and only if the character moves.

Primitive
Roll twice and use the lower value for this weapons damage.

Proven
Roll twice and use the higher value for this weapons damage.

Reload (X)
After attacking with this weapon, characters must spend X AP 
using a Ready Secondary Action in order to reload this weapon 
before they can attack with it again.

Shield Splitter
Attacks from this weapon halve the BR of shields used to block 
them (round up).

Sling
This weapon does not use conventional ammunition; instead, 
it uses small rocks and other similarly-sized and shaped objects. 
Ammunition can be specifically purchased or crafted for this 
weapon but the materials damage bonus is not applied.

Small
This weapon cannot be used to Parry or Counter attacks from 2 
handed weapons. Readying it does not cost an AP. The wielder 
may make a Subterfuge skill test to conceal the weapon. Enemies 

with normal weapons can make opportunity attacks against 
characters with this weapon who enter their range.

Snare
This weapon can be used to perform the Bash and Trip Special 
Actions while ignoring the 2 meter range limitation. Doing 
so always uses the attackers Combat Style skill against the 
defenders Athletics or Evade skill.

Thrown (X/Y/Z)
This weapon can be thrown as a ranged attack against a target  
within X/Y/Z meters. Resolve this like a normal ranged attack 
(though Strength can be a base for the test), dealing the weapons 
normal damage and ignoring Slashing/Crushing/Splitting.

Unwieldy
Attempts to parry or Counter-Attack using this weapon suffer 
a -20 penalty. 

Ranged & Melee Weapons

 

 

Weapon Attributes
All weapons have most of these attributes associated with them:
         Damage (Dam): The damage dealt by the weapon. Typically 
expressed as a die roll to which a value may be added.
        Handedness: How many hands the weapon requires.
 
 

         One Handed: Weapon can be wielded in one hand. 
    Hand and a Half: Weapon may be used with one or 
two hands (cannot be dual wielded). When using it in 
two hands, use the larger damage value (in parenthesis).
 
         Two Handed: Weapon requires the use of two hands.
         Reach: A melee weapons range in meters. Represents effec-
tive threat range and not merely the length of the weapon. 
Weapons with a minimum range (such as 2-3m) cannot 
attack targets below their minimum range.
 Range: A ranged weapons short, medium, and long ranges. 
Attacking targets in close range provides a +10 bonus 
to attack tests with the weapon, while attacking targets 
at long range imposes a -20 penalty.
        ENC: The weapons Encumbrance value.
         Qualities: Any Weapon Qualities the weapon has.
         Price: The base price of the weapon in Drakes.

 

 

 
 
 

Weapon Materials
Every weapon is made of something, and the material of a 
weapon can dramatically improve its effectiveness. When pick-
ing a weapon from either the ranged or melee weapon tables, 
you must pick a material for that weapon as well from the 
appropriate table below. 

A weapons material determines...

 

       Enchant  Level:  The  maximum  soul  energy  of  any 

172

 

enchantment that can be placed on the weapon.
       Price Modifier: Modifies the base price of the weapon to 
determine the final cost (quality modifies this value). 
  Any modifiers to damage or range the weapon receives.       
  Any additional qualities the weapon has.

Weapon Quality Level
The overall quality with which a weapon is crafted can have a 
dramatic impact on how effective it is in combat. The following 
table details what each quality level does to the weapon profile.

Special Ranged Weapon Qualities
Certain extra qualities that can be used to enhance an existing 
weapon. Often only provided by skilled craftsmen.

    Spell Focus (100 drakes): Gains Focus.

Thrown Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons with the Thrown quality count as melee weap-
ons for the purposes of determining weapon material.

Ammunition
Most ranged weapons use ammunition to reload: either arrows 
(bows) or bolts (crossbows). The material of the ammunition 
modifies the damage of the weapon on the shot its used for. 
The material of the ammunition can also impart certain quali-
ties to the attack and determines the enchantment level of the 
ammunition. Ammunition is priced per 10 shots, and each shot 
is ENC 0 (so 10 shots is ENC 1).

Bolts have no unique rules associated with them, and their 
rules are built into the profile of the crossbows above. Arrows, 
on the other hand, come in one of two different types, each 
corresponding with the way that type inflicts damage. There 
are no cost differences between these types:

Arrow Types

  Slashing Arrows: The shot gains the Slashing quality (uses 

the firing characters Strength bonus as normal).

   Splitting Arrows: The shot gains the Splitting quality (uses 

the firing characters Strength bonus as normal).

176

arMor

(Crippling)
Character cannot move, and suffers a -40 to all tests.

There are many styles and types of armor that the people of 
Tamriel use to defend themselves. This section provides rules 
for the use of both worn armor and shields.

Worn Armor
Worn armor encompasses anything that a character wears to 
protect their body from harm. 

Armor Qualities
Many armor pieces and shields possess special rules, known 
as Armor Qualities, that represent specific effects or certain 
differences between armor types.

Magic
Armor with this quality is magical and provides protection 
against certain attacks, such as those of incorporeal beings. 
Shields with this quality can be used to block such attacks.

Damaged (X)
A piece of Armor or a shield with this quality has its all of its 
Armor Ratings (AR, MR, etc) or BR reduced by X. If this would 
reduce AR or BR to 0, then the item is destroyed. Natural Armor 
cannot receive this Quality. All instances of this quality stack.

Weight Classes
Most armors and shields have a weight class, reflected by one 
of the qualities below, that represents how heavy and restrictive 
that armor is. When wearing multiple different types of armor 
and/or carrying a shield, the character always uses the effects 
of their heaviest armor piece. 

(No listed class)
The armor is light enough it imposes no penalties on its user.

Light
Light armor imposes a minor penalty on a characters mobility: 
The character suffers a -10 penalty to Acrobatics skill tests.

Medium
Medium armor imposes a moderate penalty on a characters 
mobility: the character suffers a -10 penalty to Agility based tests 
(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 1. 

Heavy
Heavy armor imposes a substantial penalty on a characters 
mobility: the character suffers a -20 penalty to Agility based tests 
(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 2. 

Super-Heavy
Super-Heavy armor imposes a staggering penalty on a characters 
mobility: the character suffers a -30 penalty to Agility based tests 
(except Combat Style skill tests) and reduces their Speed by 3.

Armor Rating & Hit Locations
A given piece of armor protects a single hit location on a charac-
ters body. The standard uniform of the Imperial Legionaire, for 
example, is a steel breastplate (body), helmet (head),  pauldrons/
bracers (arms), and greaves/boots (legs). 

A piece of armors Armor Rating (AR) is a measure of how 
much protection it offers to that hit location: any physical 
attacks that strike that hit location have their damage 
reduced by its AR. Some armors also have additional AR values 
that protect against other damage types (such as magic AR).

Armor Classes
Instead of trying to keep track of the myriad styles of armor 
that exist, all armor in the UESRPG is divided into one of two 
classes: partial and full armor. 

Partial Armor is any piece of armor that does not entirely 
cover the hit location it is protecting. As a result it typically 
offers lower protection than full armor but weighs much less.

Full Armor is any piece of armor that almost entirely covers 
the hit location it is protecting. As a result it typically offers 
improved protection at the cost of increased weight.

The combination of an armors class and material are what make 
up its complete profile. It is these combinations that characters 
choose from when picking armor. Unlike the weapon tables on 
the previous pages, the armor tables on the next page have 
already factored in the effects of an armors material. Simply 
pick the one you want, and youre ready to go!

Example: The Imperial Legion armor described above would be 
classified as partial steel armor given its material and level of cov-
erage whereas a suit of plate armor would be classified as full steel 
armor instead. These classes were designed to be somewhat abstract.

Armor Attributes
All armor pieces have these attributes associated with them:

            Armor Rating (AR): Any ARs the armor piece grants to 

 
 

the hit location that it covers. 
          Qualities: Any armor qualities the armor has.
 ENC: The Encumbrance value for a given piece of armor. 
ENC is halved when armor is worn (but not for carried 
shields).

177

 
 

 

         Enchant Level (EL): The maximum soul energy of any 
enchantment that can be placed on the piece of armor.
          Price: The price of the armor piece in Drakes both for an 
individual piece (for one hit location) and the full suit.

Armor & Shield Quality
The overall quality with which a piece of armor is crafted can 
have a dramatic impact on how effective it is in combat. The 
following table details what each quality level does to the profile.

Item Quality Profile Changes

Increases weight class by one step.

No change

Superior

+100%

Special Armor Qualities
Certain extra qualities that can be used to enhance existing 
armor. Often only provided by skilled craftsmen.

 

  Runed (+25% price): Gains Magic and 1 magic AR.

Shields
Shields are defensive weapons used to protect their wielders 
from enemy attack. They are considered a type of armor in this 
system but do not follow the normal rules for armor.

Block Rating
Instead of an AR, shields have a Block Rating (BR), which 
reflects a combination of the shields coverage and toughness.
If a character blocks an attack with a shield, then the attacker 
rolls damage with the attacking weapon. If the damage result 
is less than or equal to the shields BR, nothing happens. If 
the damage result exceeds the shields BR, then the character 
takes that damage on their shield arm. Shields count their 
BR as being half as much (round up) against attacks that 
deal magic damage unless they have a unique BR listed for 
magical attacks.

This reflects the way that, while a shield can protect its user 
from harm,  using a shield to block repeated heavy hits can 
quickly drain a defenders energy even if they are still able to 
avoid direct harm. Eventually they will find themselves tiring 
and unable to maintain their defense.

Shield Types

Tower Shield
All shields can be purchased as a tower shield instead. Tower 
shields are 1 weight class heavier (to a maximum of super-heavy) 
than a normal shield of their type, have 1 higher ENC, and cost 
25% more. Tower shields grant the wielder a +10 bonus to tests 
made to block attacks, but carrying one reduces a characters 
Speed by 1.

Targe
All shields can be purchased as a targe instead. Targes are 1 
weight class lower than normal shields of their type and cost 25% 
less. Targes halve their BR (rounding up) and count as a free 
hand, but only for wielding Small weapons or when grappling.

Buckler
All shields can be purchased as a buckler instead. Bucklers are 
1 weight class lower than a normal shield of their type, have 1 
lower ENC, and cost 25% less. Bucklers can not block. Instead, 
they add an extra degree of success to all successful Parry tests. 
Additionally, when the defender wins an opposed Parry test 
they always gain Advantage, but they must pay the AP cost if 
picking the Special Action Advantage.

Think of melee as a mirror. I look to my opponents left arm 
when I am striking with my right. If he is prepared to block 
my blow, I blow not. Why exert undue force? Mindothrax 
cocked an eyebrow, But when I see his right arm tense, my 
left arm goes to my shield. You see, it takes twice as much 
power to send force than it does to deflect it. When your eye 
can recognize whether your opponent is striking from above, 
or at angle, or in an uppercut from below, you learn to pivot 
and place your shield just so to protect yourself. I could block 
for hours if need be, but it only takes a few minutes, or even 
seconds, for your opponent, used to battering, to leave a space 
open for your own strike.

GoodS & ServiCeS

This section contains prices for all the common, everyday things 
that characters need to survive, the luxuries that separate the 
rich from the poor, and all the various properties and services 
that adventurers might need on their journey.

Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses are a simple, average number players can 
use to track their spending during downtime and reflect the 
average amount a character spends on a daily basis to maintain 
a lifestyle of a certain comfort level. More comfortable lifestyles 
are typically more expensive but bring potential advantages in 
ones status and perception. 

These expenses include housing, food, entertainment, and all 
the other costs a character might accrue during normal daily life.

Food & Drink
The various cultures of Tamriel eat many different foods. For 
convenience, simply assume that food purchased reflects the 
food of the local culture unless the character goes out of their 
way to find something else. Superior quality food tastes better, 
but otherwise there are no game effects. 

When consuming alcohol, every drink a character consumes 
in excess of their Endurance bonus causes them to lose 1 SP.

effect, though the GM might rule that characters can learn 
certain things by reading books or by giving them bonuses on

Tamriel is a land of innumerable magical wonders, many of 
which find their way into the markets and guild halls of average 
Tamrielic cities. This section contains prices for those items.

Soul Gems
Soul gems are gems that can be used to capture the souls of men 
and beasts. There are a number of different soul gems, each of 
which has its own maximum soul energy and can only hold 
certain types of souls. Black souls are the souls of men, mer, 
and the beast races. All other creatures have white souls. Soul 
gems have an ENC of 0.

Characters can also purchase soul gems that are completely, or 
only partially, full. The price of filled soul gems can be deter-
mined with the following formula: 

Filled Soul Gem Price: 
Gem Price + (Gem Price * [% full, as decimal])

Enchanted Items
Finding an enchanted item for sale can be difficult, and when 
they are for sale they are often extraordinarily expensive due to 
how rare skilled enchanters are. Only mages regularly traffic in 
these items, and they know their true value. The price of the item 
should incorporate the price of the base item and the strength 
of the enchantment. The GM should feel free to select from the 
prices below based on what they feel is appropriate, but note 
that these prices are just estimates and are not as accurate as 
pricing the items using the rules in the next section.

Enchantment Services
Enchanted items can be extremely powerful and extremely 
expensive. Characters can hire enchanters to create items with 
enchantments of all types. Their cost is determined by the 
following formula:

Enchanted Item Price: Soul Gem + Item + Fee

The formula above assumes the character is paying for the soul 
gem, the base item, and the enchanting service. If the character 
is providing either the soul gem, the base item, or both, then 
ignore that portion of the cost. The fee the enchanter charges 
should be based on the total spell level of the enchantment. The 
table below provides a guideline for the GMs use:

All of these prices assume a Binding Strength of 3 for the purposes 
of cast enchantments. Higher/lower binding strengths require 
more/less skilled enchanters, which increase/decrease the total price 
by 20% for each step (max 5).

Spell Scrolls
Spell scrolls are single use items that have had a particular spell 
bound to them through the use of enchanting. By reading the 
magical inscription on the scroll the character can invoke the 
stored magic without the difficulty of casting it themselves.

Spell Tomes & Training
Spell tomes are one of the ways that characters can learn conven-
tional spells. Spell tomes are books (despite their name, they can 
be fairly small) that contain the knowledge necessary to use a 
given spell. They not only contain practical instructions for using 
the spell, but a history of the evolution of the spell, alternative 
forms of casting, mnemonic devices, and other information that 
can help a character attain a full understanding of the magic 
they are learning to use. 

Learning a spell from a tome takes a number of days equal to 
the spell level. This time must be spent in practice and study.

Alternatively, a character can be taught a spell. This takes one 
less day (to a minimum of 1 hour) than it would take to learn 
the spell from a tome but also requires a teacher. Use the costs 
above as the training cost.

Alchemical Ingredients
Potions are created using alchemical ingredients. Higher quality 
ingredients have higher strength, allowing for more powerful 
effects. The following table lists the various quality levels and 
costs of alchemical ingredients of any given type and their cor-
responding strength and depth values:

Alchemist Services
Potions can be quite useful when employed correctly. Characters 
can hire alchemists to create potions or poisons with effects of 
all types. Their cost is determined by the following formula:

Potion/Poison Price: Ingredient + Fee
Determine the effects of the created potion using the normal 
potion or poison creation rules found in the Alchemy section. 
The formula above assumes the character is paying for the ingre-
dient and the alchemy service. If the character is providing the 
ingredients, then ignore that portion of the cost. The fee the 
alchemist charges should be based on the total spell level of the 
potion. The table below provides a guideline for the GMs use:

CraftinG

The variety of items found in this Chapter do not simply make 
themselves: someone has to gather the materials and create the 
item. This section contains rules for characters wishing to create 
items of all types.|

Step 1: Determine Item
First, the character must choose the item they wish to create. 
Some items cannot be created, such as those that only occur 
naturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining 
if a character can craft an item. The character must also choose 
the quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined 
with the items base price will allow them to determine the 
approximate market value of the item.

Step 2: Gather Raw Materials
Next the character must gather the raw materials necessary to 
create the item. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to 
item, but as a general rule of thumb if the character wishes 
to purchase all the raw materials it will cost roughly one 
third of the items standard price.

Step 3: Determine Test Difficulty
Third the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test. 
The difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely 
on the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees 
fit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides 
a modifier. See the tables below for test difficulties.

Step 4: Make Crafting Test
Next the character makes the actual crafting test using the diffi-
culty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character 
tests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons 
or armor uses the Profession [Smithing] skill, while other items 
will usually use some other variation of the Profession [Field] 
skill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical 
success halves the time required.

Creating any item requires the appropriate craft tools. In the 
case of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge 
(along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete 
the product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from 
a few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During 
this time the character must be focused on creating the item. 
The duration required is left to the GM and should be based 
on the complexity of the item in question.

Runed Weapons & Armor
Characters with knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons 
and armor with magic runes that make them effective against 
certain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant 
test when creating the item. On success, add the Magic quality 
to the armor or weapon. On failure, the item is created without 
the Magic quality and the test cannot be repeated for this item. 

Repairing Weapons & Armor
Much like people, gear does not always survive combat. In the 
event that a weapon or piece of armor is damaged, a character 
can attempt to repair it with a Profession [Smithing] skill test. 
This takes about an hour and requires raw materials worth five 
percent of the price of the item. Given a successful skill test, the 
character can reduce the X value of the Damaged (X) weapon/
armor quality on the damaged item by their degrees of success.

Daedric Weapons & Armor
The Daedra are undisputed masters of craftsmanship, and it 
is possible for mortals to utilize many of their secret ritual 
techniques to create Daedric armor and weaponry, which draw 
power from a Daedric soul consumed during the creation of 
the item itself. However, detailed knowledge of the specifics of 
this process can be hard to come across.

Daedric equipment is made by binding Daedric essence to ebony. 
As such, the process for creating Daedric armor or weaponry 
is mostly the same as it would be for the ebony equivalent but 
with a -40 penalty to the crafting test rather than the usual -30. 
Additionally, the character may only work at night and must 
have a Soul Gem containing the captured soul of a Daedra.

Halfway through the process the character must make a -10 
Enchant skill test. On failure they are unable to bind the soul 

188

properly and the only thing that they can salvage from their 
efforts is the ebony version of the item. On success, the soul is 
bound to the item and its power begins to twist the item into 
its Daedric form. The Willpower of the captured Daedra caps 
the items quality as specified below. Either way, the soul gem 
is destroyed and the energy within is lost.
