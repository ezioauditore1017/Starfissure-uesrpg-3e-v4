# Chapter 6: Magic

The Charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are. Your imagination 
and your Willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and 
after you cast the Charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse 
what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fires reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, 
its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.

Sotha Sil, 2920, Last Year of the First Era

 
There are a number of ways that any given magical effect can be 
manifested. The main four methods of using magic (listed below) 
are the focus of this chapter, as they are the most common 
means of manipulating magicka.

 

 

    Spellcasting allows characters to draw on their own 
magicka reserves in order to generate an effect in the 
physical world. Spell casters cast spells using the skill cor-
responding to the school of magic that the spell is associated 
with. Casters either learn spells or create them from ones 
they already know, though this can be risky.
    Enchanting involves using the magicka from souls them-
selves to fuel magic stored within an object. Enchanters 
can use the Enchanting skill to create a number of different 
items with many possible effects. 

 

      Alchemy uses the magicka trapped within different things 
as power to fuel potions with magical effects. Alchemists 
can use the Alchemy skill to create a variety of potions. 
    Ritual Magic is a form of spellcasting that, while it often 
requires extensive preparation, can produce potent effects. 
Thus Ritual Magic uses the six standard spellcasting Skills, 
though the amount of power involved means that rituals 
can prove quite dangerous if botched.

Racial and Birthsign powers can be found in Powers in Chapter 
2. Other advanced forms of magic exist as well: their rules can 
be found in the Elite Advances section.

Very few can master it, but all are touched by its presence. 

Magic is the general term used for the focusing of the raw 
energy that flows from Aetherius into Mundus by way of the sun 
and stars into various properties and for various purposes. This 
energy is often referred to as magicka. All magical energy comes 
from Aetherius, and from its magicka Mundus was created. 
Magicka comprises every spirit; it is the energy of all living 
things and can be harnessed in a variety of ways. This chapter 
contains rules for magic in its most common forms, as well as 
other aspects of the arcane that may be relevant in the course 
of the players adventure.

The various magic effects are divided into parent Schools of 
magic. Exactly which schools are recognized, and how theyre 
organized, varies from era to era in Tamriel, but for the sake 
of simplicity this rulebook will utilize the following schools:

      The school of Alteration revolves around altering the 
physical and magical properties of the world. This can 
be used to augment the self and allies, or hinder enemies.
      The school of Conjuration focuses on calling upon oth-
erworldly entities. These entities can manifest in a number 
of different forms.

      The school of Destruction centers on harming targets in 
a variety of ways. Either through direct damage or sapping 
their abilities and defenses. 

      The school of Illusion focuses on affecting light and the 
minds of sentient targets. Illusion can be used to manipulate 
an enemys perception of reality, or augment ones own.
      The school of Mysticism is a more obscure school, and 
its spells manipulate magicka itself. Mysticism can be used 
for many effects, including binding and trapping souls, or 
reflecting spells.

      The school of Restoration revolves around augmenting 
and restoring the abilities and body of a target. It also 
contains effects that can be used against the undead.

These are not the only schools of magic in the UESRPG either. 
Certain supplements contain more obscure or dangerous rules 
for characters wishing to harness unique varieties of magic.

Note - Schools 
The makeup of the schools of magic have varied drastically 
over the eras. The division portrayed here is the one 
utilized in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. If playing a 
game in a different era, it is possible to simply regroup 
the spells and effects to reflect the historically correct 
school-division. Alternatively the group can simply leave 
things as they are for convenience.

SpellCaStinG

Spellcasting is the act of drawing on ones own magicka reserves 
in order to generate some sort of effect on the world. Spells can 
be used to create, change, destroy, or manipulate the world and 
the beings within it.

Spell Components
Casting spells requires a combination of physical components 
(typically precise hand motions), verbal components (incan-
tations or words of power), and the mental component of 
channeling ones magicka into the desired effect. Characters 
can combine all three of these components in order to produce 
a magical effect, which is known as casting a spell. 

Spell Levels
Each spells Spell Level is used to determine how much 
magicka it costs for a character to cast (the specific cost will be 
listed with the spell). Higher level spells produce more powerful 
effects. Each level of a spell is its own distinct spell and must 
be learned separately. Some spells have fewer than 7 levels.

Learning a spell takes a number of days equal to the level 
of the spell and typically requires a character to study from 
a spell tome or learn from a teacher.

Spell Schools
Each spell has one or more associated schools of magic. These 
reflect the type of effect the spell generates and also determine 
which skill(s) the character must use in order to cast it.

Spell Types
In addition to whatever school it is associated with, spells fall 
into one of two types: Conventional or Unconventional spells.

Conventional Spells are tried and true spells that fall clearly 
within a single school and produce only a single effect. They are 
spells that have been refined over generations by the mages of 
Tamriel: simple incantations and patterns that produce reliable 
effects. In game terms conventional spells are premade spells; 
they exist as a set of  easy premade options to choose from. 

Unconventional Spells are spells that produce more than a 
single effect, can be classified as belonging to more than one 
school, or are simply a unique variation on a standard effect. 
These spells are considered the realm of over-eager apprentices 
and learned masters: experimental magic that can bring great 
risks and great rewards. In game terms unconventional spells 
are custom spells; they are how players can tinker with magic.

Spell Attributes
Many spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify 
their rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The 
effects for these attributes are detailed in the Conventional 
Spells section later in this chapter.

Effect Durations
Effect durations are measured in rounds and end immediately 
after the initiative step on which they took effect. For example, 
if an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their turn, they remain 
stunned until right after the end of their turn 2 rounds later 
(assuming their turn takes place at the same initiative step as 

127

it did originally).

Casting Spells
In structured time, characters use the Cast Magic action to cast 
spells. Follow these steps to resolve spellcasts:

Step 1: Caster Declares Spell and Targets
First the caster must choose a spell to cast from among those they 
know. If the spell has a target (or targets) other than themself, 
they must choose them now provided they satisfy the spell 
conditions (range, etc).

Step 2: Casting Test
The caster makes a skill test with the skill corresponding to the 
school of the spell (the Destruction skill for Destruction spells, 
and so forth). This test suffers a -10 penalty for each point 
by which the spell level exceeds the characters Spellcasting 
Level with that spell. Their Spellcasting Level is determined 
by taking the spells school skill level and adding one.  If the 
character is untrained in that schools skill, the Spellcasting 
Level in that school is considered zero, and they cannot cast 
spells from that school.

Spell Components
If the character cannot speak they suffer a -20 penalty to the 
casting test. They suffer an additional -20 penalty to the test if 
they do not have two free hands, either because they are holding 
items or because their movement is restricted in some way.

Step 3: Resolve the Spell
Pass or fail, the caster reduces their magicka by the listed cost of 
the spell. If this would reduce the characters magicka to below 
zero, then the spell is not successfully cast.

If the caster passed the test, resolve the effects of the spell as 
written. If the character is casting a multi-part spell, then resolve 

each part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the 
parts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).

 

Attack Spells
Spells with the attack attribute count as attacks. They are 
resolved as appropriate for an attack of that type (either ranged 
or melee):
     The casting test for the spell is also the attack test, and the 
casters degrees of success are compared to the defenders.
   Spell casting tests can suffer from circumstantial modifiers 
that the GM rules are appropriate.
   Spells cannot gain or benefit from advantages.
   Spells cannot be parried or countered, only blocked/evaded.
   Critical successes cause damaging spells to deal maximum 
damage. Non-damaging spells double their Magicka cost 
reduction from Spell Restraint (still subject to the 1 cost 
minimum).
     Spells cannot benefit from Stamina points.
  Spells with the AoE attribute are resolved as AoE attacks.

 
 
 

 
 

Spell Restraint
On a successful spellcast, a mage can use their will to limit 
excessive use of magicka. This is known as Spell Restraint 
or restrained spellcasting. A character can choose to reduce the 
cost of a successfully cast spell by their Willpower bonus to a 
minimum of 1. 

While typically this is desirable, sometimes not holding back 
with a spell can have extra benefits. Some spells have the 
Overload attribute, which will state certain extra effects the 
character can benefit from if they choose not to restrain the 
spell when casting it.

Magical Backfires
If a character critically fails when casting a spell, or fails normally 
when casting either an unconventional spell or any spell with a 
spell level above their Spellcasting Level in the corresponding 
school, then they suffer a Magical Backfire. A Magical Backfire is 
an uncontrolled, and often harmful, consequence of incorrectly 
manipulating unfamiliar magic. Find the table corresponding 
to the backfired spells school in the Magical Mishaps section, 
roll a d4, and add the spell level to the result of the roll.

Resolving Opposing Spell Effects
Certain spell effects can be seen as opposing (Enrage and Calm, 
for instance), which can bring some confusion if a target struck 
by one is then hit by the other. Resolve all such instances by 
simply assuming that the newer spell effect overrides the old one.

128

Conventional SpellS

   Conventional spells are tried and true spells that fall clearly 
within a single school and produce only a single effect. They are 
spells that have been refined over generations by the mages of 
Tamriel: simple, elegant incantations and patterns that produce 
reliable effects. This section contains rules for using conventional 
spells and a full list of them.

   Spell Profiles
   Each conventional spell profile listed here includes the follow-
ing: the name of the spell, its school, its spell level(s)/strength, 
corresponding magicka costs, spell attributes, and rules for 
resolving the spell. The Spell Strength of a spell is simply a 
variable that is used to quantify the strength of the spell in its 
rules entry, and that is based on the spell level.

Unless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack with 
themselves.

Spell Attributes
   Many spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify 
their rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The rules 
for spell attributes apply to all types of spells but are included 
in this section for convenience:

  Attack: Using this effect is considered an Attack for the 

purposes of determining Attacks per round.

  Instant: This spell can be cast using a Secondary Action, 
permitting the caster to either cast the spell on their turn 
or as a Reaction outside of their turn.

  Upkeep: The caster can, as a free action, refresh the 
effect (including any required tests or rolls, not includ-
ing the casting test, using the original target(s)) and 
duration  of  this  spell  when  it  ends  by  paying  the 
original cost that they paid for the spell as long as the 
requirements  for  the  spell  (like  range)  are  still  met. 

the spell if they have cast a different spell since the original 
cast. If a spell has the Attack attribute, then upkeeping the 
spell counts toward the maximum attacks per round limit.
 Overload: The caster benefits from an extra effect (as spec-
ified) if not restraining this spell.
 Reinforce: By default, spells with the Reinforce attribute 
have no extra effects. When a character takes the Mage 
Guard and the Arcane Defender talents, they benefit from 
a bonus to the spell effect if not restraining the spell.
    Ranged (range): Spell can affect a target within the listed 
range.
    Melee (range): Spell counts as melee with the listed range. 
Does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

 

 

 

 

 

      AoE (range, form): This spell counts as a ranged, area of 
effect of the given form/radius. Pulse form AoEs affect 
the caster.
   Direct: This spell has a target or targets but is not an attack 
and cannot be defended against by normal means.
     Mindlock (X): Reduces the casters max AP by X to a 
minimum of zero. 
     [Variation]: This spell has multiple variations, each cor-
responding to one of the listed items. Each variation is its 
own spell that must be learned separately. 

 

 

Alteration
   The school of Alteration revolves around altering the physical 
and magical properties of the world. This can be used to aug-
ment the self and allies or hinder enemies. 

Armor
Normal physical armor is far too bulky for most mages. This spell 
magically reinforces ones being to be on par with even the most 
well forged steel.

This piece of armor magically replaces whatever armor the caster 
is currently wearing on that location for one minute. The armor 
piece counts as one weight class lighter for the purpose of armor 
penalties and does not need to be among the casters trained 
armor classes in its combat style. The armour has the Bound 
and Summoned traits.

Summons a Bound Daedric weapon or shield of casters choice 
that follows the profile determined by its [Spell Strength]. The 
weapon type must be determined when the spell is learned.

This weapon appears in the casters hand(s) for the duration 
of the spell or until the weapon leaves the casters hands. The 
caster gains a [Spell Strength] weapon (with ammo) with the 
Bound and Summoned traits of the chosen type for 1 minute. 
Weapons with the reload quality are not loaded when they 
are summoned; however, the value of the first reload action is 
reduced by 1. If the weapon is not in any of the casters Combat 
Styles, they count it as being Trained (+0).

Summons a construct with the Summoned trait, which appears 
within five meters of the caster. Immediately after being sum-
moned, the Construct must make a Willpower test against 
the DoS of the Conjuration test. If the Conjurer wins the test, 
the Construct gains the Bound trait and persists for 1 round. 
If the Construct wins the Opposed test, it is not Bound and 
can act as it pleases, typically murdering its summoner. The 
unbound Construct can test Willpower at the end of each round 
to maintain itself in Mundus.

Keeping the Construct in line imposes [Spell Str] Mindlock on 
the caster. Roll initiative for the Construct when its summoned, 
as it acts on its own turn. If the spell ends because the caster 
chooses not to upkeep this spell and the summoned creature 
has the Bound trait, the creature loses the Summoned trait and 
returns to their plane of origin.

If this spell is restrained, the summoned creatures Maximum AP 
is reduced by 1 while they have the Bound trait. If the Spell is 
Upkept, summoned creatures do not retest their Willpower test. 

For each time the spell is purchased, pick one spell profile from

 Creates a magical rune that takes up 1 square meter on target 
surface within 1 meter. After a 1 round delay the rune becomes 
barely visible (-20 to any vision based tests to spot it). The caster 
chooses one or more conditions upon which the rune detonates. 
The rune persists indefinitely.

 

 
 

   Proximity: The rune detonates whenever a character comes 
within a certain distance (chosen by the caster).
   Time: The rune detonates after a set amount of time.
   Manual: The caster can detonate the rune manually from 
any distance by using the Cast Magic action.

 When the rune detonates it does so in a burst of elemental 
energy, dealing [Spell Strength] [type] damage to all targets 
within 3 meters. This counts as an area of effect attack and can 
be evaded, but only if a character is aware of the rune.

 Target character within 50m has their soul magically tethered

hold the souls of men, mer, and the beast races) of the casters 
choice within 1m of their person. If the target dies within 
1 minute, then their soul is trapped within the gem, and it 
gains soul energy equal to the size of their soul. If this spell is 
affected by a Reflect spell or effect, then the casters own soul 
is trapped within the chosen soul gem. Soul Trap is seen as a 
hostile action when cast on an unwilling target, but it is not 
considered an Attack.

Necromancy
Necromancy is the dark art of death magic, and of raising the 
dead and creating undead monstrosities. Necromancy is fuelled 
by black magicks and feeds on the living, and serves as an 
enticing shortcut to power for the less scrupulous mages that 
roam Tamriel.

Restoration
The school of Restoration revolves around augmenting and 
restoring the abilities and body of a target. It also contains effects 
that can be used specifically against the Undead.

Target corpse of [Spell Strength] size is reanimated for one 
minute, using the profile it had in life. The target must imme-
diately test an Opposed Willpower with the caster. If the caster 
wins the test, the target also has the Bound trait. If the target 
wins the test, they are reanimated but are not Bound to the caster.

Cure Disease
Disease can be a taxing event while adventuring. Stop disease in 
its tracks and continue on wherever you go.

The target is reanimated with full HP, Stamina Points, Action

The spell imbues the body with the spirit of a lesser daedra, 
and has no shred of the characters consciousness, soul, or any 
knowledge of their past life except for skills, talents, traits, and 
spells. They do not retain powers gained from their race.

After the reanimated creature dies again or if the spell ends (due 
to unpaid upkeep or any other reason), the reanimated creature 
turns to a pile of ash and cannot be reanimated.

unConventional SpellS

Unlike the tried and true conventional spells, unconventional 
spells are the realm of unique, experimental, and potentially 
dangerous magic. 

Unconventional Spells are spells that produce more than a 
single effect, can be classified as belonging to more than one 
school, or are simply a unique variation on a standard effect. 
These spells are considered the realm of over-eager apprentices 
and learned masters: experimental magic that can bring both 
great risks and great rewards.

In game terms unconventional spells are custom spells. There 
is no list of them, it is the catch all term for the unique 
spells that can be created from the various magical effects 
and forms that exist within the system. This section contains 
rules for creating and using your own unconventional spells.

Important Note 
The creation and use of Unconventional Spells provides 
casters with a powerful system to customize their spell 
arsenal and is integral to the classic Elder Scrolls expe-
rience. This system was designed with flexibility and 
customization as priorities, which leaves it vulnerable to 
the creation of over-powered spells and spell effect combi-
nations. Players should always review Unconventional 
Spells with their GM before they are implemented in 
play.

Creating a Spell
Creating an unconventional spell is a matter of putting pieces 
together to make a functioning spell that can be used like any 
of the premade conventional spells.

The Basics
The two pieces that players can combine to create spells are 
called effects and forms.

An Effect is the actual content of a spell: the fire effect causes 
fire damage while the heal effect heals it. A Form is the shape 
of the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fireball, 
which uses the ball form) while others are cast only on the 
caster themself (the self  form).

Creating a spell is a matter of combining effects and forms 
that are allowed to fit together, setting the parameters of each, 
and then writing down the combined result so that you can 
reference it during gameplay.

Multi Part Spells
Unconventional spells can also be multi-part spells, which simply 
means that they contain multiple spells in a single spell. For 
example a character might create a spell that when cast allows 
them to both jump further and walk on water, which are two 
separate effects. These distinct parts are referred to as Spell Parts, 
while the spell containing them is referred to as the Parent Spell.  

When a character is casting a multi-part spell, they should resolve 
each part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the 
parts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).

Learning Effects & Forms
A character can use any form when creating an unconventional 
spell, but may only utilize effects from schools of magic in which 
they are trained (meaning the skill is novice rank or higher).
Spell Attributes
Spell attributes are tags that modify the rules of a spell or clarify 
how they function in game terms. Effects and forms each have 
spell attributes associated with them that are combined when 
the complete spell profile is created.
