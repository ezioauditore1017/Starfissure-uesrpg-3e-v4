# Chapter 3: Skills

To achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is youre doing. It aint simply enough to perform a 

perfect thrust of a blade -- you must also know what you are doing and why.

Most tasks that a character can perform are measured by 

their skills. Skill ranks reflect the characters experience, 
training, and overall ability to perform these actions. Skills 
are either trained or untrained. Each trained skill has a corre-
sponding Skill Rank, which has an associated value from 0 
to 5. This reflects how capable the character is at utilizing that 
skill. Each skill has one or more Governing Characteristics: a 
set of characteristics that reflect the many ways that a character 
can utilize a single skill. 

Skill Ranks

Skill Rank (Value)

Journeyman (2) (+20)

300 (600) Competent.

When a character makes a skill test, they apply a bonus equal 
to +10 times the value of their skill rank (starting at +0 for 
novice [rank 0], and up to +50 at master [rank 5]) to the chosen 
characteristic. Typically the player chooses which characteristic 
to use, but the GM may require that they must use a particular 
one if they feel the circumstances dictate such. If a character 
uses an untrained skill, the test suffers a -20 penalty.

Specializations
Trained skills can also have accompanying Specializations, 
which represent areas of concentration and focus in a characters 
training and experience with that skill. A character may take as 
many specializations as their rank in a given skill for 100 Xp 
each. When making a skill test in the listed area of specializa-
tion, the character gains an additional +10 bonus to the test. A 
character may not benefit from more than one specialization 
at once. Example specializations are provided for each skill, but 
players should feel free to create their own with GM permission.

Skill Types
There are two types of skills, Standard Skills and Field Skills. 
Standard skills function as described above, but field skills are 
different and can be identified by the [Field] in their name. 

Field skills are collections of related skills that all function inde-
pendently as standard skills. For example: Profession [Smithing] 
and Profession [Medicine] function as separate skills that must 
be trained and ranked up independently. Both skills have their 
own separate skill rank, though they function similarly because 
they share the same parent skill. Sometimes the fields will share 
governing characteristics, but sometimes each will have its own.

Learning and Advancing Skills
The XP cost to learn a skill (upgrade it to trained, novice rank) 
is 100 XP. From then on, the cost to advance to the desired 
rank varies. Skill ranks are advanced in order.

Favored Skills
A characters favored skills are those skills that are governed by 
at least one of the characters Favored Characteristics. Favored 
skills cost 75% of the usual XP to advance in rank or gain a 
specialization in (round down to the nearest multiple of 5).

Example Specializations: Lockpicking, Sleight of Hand, Traps

Combat Styles
Fighting skills are packaged into Combat Styles, which repre-
sent the complete package of training, tactics, and experience 
that constitutes a specific style of combat. Combat Styles can 
be associated with culture, careers, or even schools of combat. 

Specifically, individual Combat Styles are represented by the 
Combat Style [Field] skill, where the field is the name of the 
combat style. This skill is used to make melee (or ranged) attack 
and defense tests in combat when using the equipment associ-
ated with the style. The character may use either their Strength 
or Agility as a base for the skill test when making melee attacks 
and most defense tests but must use their Agility when making 
ranged attacks. 

Rather than creating preset combat styles we have allowed play-
ers and GMs to invent their own to more accurately reflect the 
characters they wish to portray. Each combat style should be 
accompanied by a list of equipment it incorporates (see below), 
and a description of the style of fighting that it represents (see 
examples to the bottom right).

Trained Equipment
Each Combat Style has an associated set of weapon, armor, and 
shield types. A character with that Combat Style is capable of 
using that equipment effectively in the situations the style is 
designed for. Combat Styles may include up to five different 
types of equipment when the skill is purchased for the first 
time. Unarmed combat is included in this category as well, 
reflecting that the character is trained to fight without weapons. 
Armor is divided into types using the associated weight class 
quality: light, medium, heavy, or super heavy. Armor without 
a quality requires no training.

Each styles associated trained equipment is chosen when the 
character learns the style, and it can be expanded to a maximum 
of ten different types of equipment. Expanding a combat style 
by adding a weapon, armor, or shield type to the list of a 
styles trained equipment costs 25 XP.

Special Advantages
In addition to equipment, each Combat Style also has an associ-
ated set of Special Advantages. This list is a set of Special Actions 
(page 100) that the character is able to use as an advantage 
instead of the listed action type. A Combat Style starts with a 
single chosen Special Action in this list of Special Advantages. 
Expanding this list of Special Advantages costs 25 XP per 
Special Action. There is no limit to the number of Special 
Advantages that can be included in a Combat Style.

When the character uses this special action as an advantgage, 
they ignore the AP cost, or automatically win any opposed 
roll involved.

Fighting in Unfamiliar Circumstances
Occasionally characters may be forced to fight with familiar 
weapons, but in strange circumstances. For example, a noble 
who is used to fighting honorable one-on-one duels might be 
forced into a chaotic bar-brawl. Or perhaps a battlefield soldier 
used to fighting on horseback finds themself face to face with 
an assassin at home.

Generally most characters are trained to use the weapons in 
their style in widely applicable circumstances, but in certain 
cases like these the GM shouldnt be afraid to impose a -10 
penalty (or more, if appropriate) on Combat Style tests made 
by a character who is out of their element.

The Princes longblade slashed across the Akavirs chest and 
the sudden, intense pain cuased him to drop his weapons. In 
a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostrate in the 
dust with the Princes longsword at this throat. The games 
over! shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause 
from the stadium. 

2920, The Last Year of the First Era

Utilizing Untrained Weapons/Armor
Characters who use weapons, armor, or other equipment that 
they are not trained to use suffer the usual -20 penalty for using 
an untrained skill on any associated combat tests, movement 
tests in the case of armor, or any other tests that the GM deems 
appropriate. The GM may choose to alter or ignore this penalty 
if they feel the circumstances do not apply.

69

 
 
 
Combat Style Examples
Below are some example Combat Styles to use for inspiration 
in your campaigns.

  Special Advantages:

opponents in duels of honor and skill. In open battle they wear 
heavy armor and fight primarily from horseback.

 

          Equipment: Lance, Shield, Longsword, Mace, Heavy 
Armor.
