## Alteration

### **Ash Rune**

_“A classic ward against solicitors amongst the Telvanni magelords”_

Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|6|12|18|24|32|38|44|
|**Spell Strength**|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|-40|

Creates a magical rune on the target surface within 1 meter. After a 1 round delay the rune becomes barely visible (-20 to any vision based tests to spot it). The caster chooses one or more conditions upon which the rune detonates. The rune persists indefinitely.

**• Proximity:** The rune detonates whenever a character comes within a certain distance (chosen by the caster).

**• Time:** The rune detonates after a set amount of time.

**• Manual:** The caster can detonate the rune manually from any distance by using the Cast Magic action.

When the rune detonates the creature closest to it within 5m must make a Willpower test with a [Spell Strength] modifier or be encased in ash or dust for 1 round. The target is functionally paralyzed and blinded (Can’t move any body part and may only cast spells that do not require speech or motion). It is also immune to all damage and is rooted to the ground and can’t be moved without destroying the shell.

### **Ash Shell**

_“Why put all that time and effort into carving marble statues of people when you can just encase them in ash?”_

Upkeep, Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|6|12|18|24|32|38|44|
|**Spell Strength**|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|-40|

Target within 50m must make a Willpower test with a [Spell Strength] modifier or be encased in ash or dust for 1 round. The target is functionally paralyzed and blinded (Can’t move any body part and may only cast spells that do not require speech or motion). It is also immune to all damage and is rooted to the ground and can’t be moved without destroying the shell.

### **Equilibrium**

_“When you hate the enemy so much you’re willing to sap your own lifeforce to keep hurting them”_

Equilibrium is also a Restoration spell

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|2|4|6|8|10|12|14|
|**Spell Strength**|4|6|8|10|12|14|16|

This spell works slightly differently than a regular spell. Its cost represents the amount of HP it drains and the [Spell Strength] are the points of magicka you regain.

### **Mass Paralysis**

_“A last resort for overwhelmed mages. Rarely works as intended and expensive to cast but can take out a whole party of enemies in one fell swoop”_

Upkeep, Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|12|24|36|48|60|72|84|
|**Spell Strength**|+30|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|

All creatures of the casters choosing within 5m must make a Willpower test with a [Spell Strength] modifier or be paralyzed for one round.

### **Smoke Bomb**

_“No need to hide yourself when you can just hide everyone else”_

AoE (10m, sphere), Upkeep

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|3|6|9|12|15|18|21|
|**Spell Strength**|-5|-10|-15|-20|-25|-30|-35|

Target point within 100m explodes in a dark smoke cloud. All Targets within 10m suffer a [Spell Strength] penalty to Attack and Defense rolls as well as all sight based tests for 1 round. The same goes for anyone trying to perceive or fire into the cloud. Upkeeping the spell does not let you move the smoke cloud, it merely refreshes the effect and duration.

### **Transmute**

_“Turn shit into gold! Literally! Well, maybe not quite literally.”_

Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|5|10|15|20|25|30|35|
|**Spell Strength**|1|3|5|10|20|30|50|

The Caster transforms an unrefined piece of iron into silver or a piece of unrefined silver into gold by touching it. The original piece of metal can be no bigger than [Spell Str] cm3. The effect wears off after 1d4 hours and the material reverts to its original form.

## Destruction

### **[Type] Wall**

_“You shall not pass!”_

R Attack, AoE (10m, wall), Upkeep, [Fire, Frost, Shock]

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|
|**Spell Strength**|1d4|1d6|1d8|1d10|2d6|2d8|2d10|

Target point within 100m erupts in a 10m long, 1m wide and 5m high wall for one round. It deals [Spell Strength] [type] damage to all targets that try to move past it. Any character that occupies the same space as the wall when it is cast must successfully evade the attack or take damage. Upkeeping the spell does not let you move the wall, it merely refreshes the effect and duration.

### **Whirlwind Cloak**

_“No better protection than just not letting your enemies get close to you.”_

Upkeep

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|7|14|21|28|35|42|49|
|**Spell Strength**|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|-40|

A whirling wind picks up around the caster. Characters who come within 1m meter of the character must pass a Strength or Athletics test with a [Spell Strength] modifier or be knocked prone. If cast at lvl 1-2 all ranged weapon attacks targeting the caster count as being fired in light wind. If cast at lvl 3-5 all ranged weapon attacks targeting the caster count as being fired in moderate wind. If cast at lvl 6-7 all ranged weapon attacks targeting the caster count as being fired in heavy wind.

## Illusion

### **Darkness**

_“ When there are no shadows to hide in, just make your own.”_

Upkeep

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|4|8|12|16|20|24|28|
|**Spell Strength**|10|20|30|40|50|60|70|

Creates a [Spell Strength] meters sphere of darkness around a target point within 100m for 1 round. Upkeeping the spell does not let you move the Darkness it merely refreshes the duration.

### **Deafen**

_“What?!?”_

Upkeep, Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|2|4|6|8|10|12|14|
|**Spell Strength**|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|-40|

### **Disguise**

_“Because ‘just be yourself’ has always been rubbish advice”_

Upkeep

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|7|14|21|28|35|42|49|
|**Spell Strength**|+30|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|

The caster can alter their appearance, including their clothing and equipment, to that of another black souled creature for 15 minutes. This does not alter the casters physical form. Should anyone touch a bodypart that exists outside the illusion they will find solid mass there and touching a purely illusory part of the casters body will make the other persons hand pass through the illusion. Any person that perceives or interacts with the caster can make an Observe or Investigate [Spell strength] test to see through the disguise.

### **Enthrall**

_“Why fight yourself when you can make you enemies fight for you”_

Upkeep, Direct, Mindlock (3)

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|12|24|26|38|50|62|74|
|**Spell Strength**|+30|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|

Target within 50m of the caster must pass a Willpower [Spell Strength] test or gain the Bound trait for one Round. (They do however die normally if slain)

### **Illusory Creature**

_“When you need a distraction, right now!”_

Upkeep, Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|4|8|12|16|20|24|28|
|**Spell Strength**|puny|tiny|small|standard|large|huge|massive|

Caster creates an illusory image of a creature of [Spell Strength] size or smaller for 1 minute. The creature gives off any of the sounds it normally would but is completely incorporeal and anything with mass can pass through it.  A successful Observe or Perception test with a -20 modifier (or simply touching it) betrays the image as an illusion.

## Mysticism

### **Banishment**

_“Send it back where it came from.”_

Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|12|16|20|24|28|32|36|
|**Spell Strength**|+30|+20|+10|0|-10|-20|-30|

The caster attempts to banish a creature within 50m that is native to a different plane back to it’s home plane. The affected creature must make a Willpower test with a [Spell Strength] modifier to resist the effect otherwise the creature is returned to the last location it inhabited on it’s home plane. If the spell is cast on a creature that is already native to the plane that it currently resides in then the spell has no effect. This spell can also be used to end the reanimation on a necromancers thrall, however in this case the Necromancer tests Willpower instead of the thrall.

### **Clairvoyance**

_“A handy spell for scatterbrained mages who tend to lose their keys or daedric artefacts”_

Direct

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|8|16|24|32|40|48|56|
|**Spell Strength**|100|500|1000|3000|10’000|100’000|1’000’000|

This spell allows the caster to find a person or object if it is located within a [Spell Strength] meter radius of the caster. If the goal is outside the spell radius the spell fails and the magicka for it is consumed. The same applies if the Person or Object is in a different plane of existence than the Caster (Plane of Oblivion or Aetherius if the Caster is on Mundus). A faintly glowing blue line will lead the caster to the target of the spell and persists until the goal is reached or the Caster dismisses the Spell. The blue line will follow the shortest possible path to the goal that isn’t physically blocked. Only the caster can see said blue line.

The caster has to be very familiar with the person or object to cast the spell without penalty otherwise the following penalties to the casting test apply:

_Interacted with Object or Person once for a short time: **-10**_

_Seen Object or Person once for a short time: **-15**_

_Has detailed description from someone who is very familiar with Object or Person: **-20**_

_Has somewhat accurate description of Object or Person: **-30**_

_Has vague description of Object or Person: **-40**_

_Only knows the Name of Object or Person: **-5**_**0**

Extremely powerful or mystical Items or People can only be located with a seventh level Clairvoyance spell. Examples include Daedric Artefacts, Elder Scrolls, Ancient Magical Balls of DoomTM, disappeared Heroes or legendary Magelords.

The spell also fails if its target is too vague to be considered a concrete Object or Person in the casters mind. Searching for “incriminating evidence” or “person who knows a lot about dragons” for example will cause the spell to fail. The GM has final say on what is concrete enough to fall within the spells capabilities. If the Person or Object is has a “Dispel” spell of the same level as the Clairvoyance spell cast on it, the Clairvoyance spell will be dispelled.

### **Counterspell**

_“No you dont!”_

Direct, Reaction

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|8|16|24|32|40|48|56|
|**Spell Strength**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|

As a reaction the caster can try to interrupt a spell being cast by another spellcaster within 50m that he can see. Both casters use the DoS of their casting tests to determine whether the spell can be interrupted. Ties are always resolved in favour of the initial caster (and not the person casting counterspell). If the spell is successfully interrupted the caster loses the MP for that spell (but it is treated as successfully cast for the purpose of using spell restraint). If the spell being interrupted is at a higher level than counterspell, the casting test is at -10 per higher level (so a level 1 counterspell interrupting a 2nd level spell is cast at -10 and a level 1 counterspell interrupting 4th level spell is at -30 etc.). A third party caster can attempt to counterspell the counterspell, but the caster being interrupted cannot. This spell cannot be used to interrupt the upkeep of an already cast spell.

### **Vision of the Tenth Eye**

_“When you really need to see more than meets the eye”_

Upkeep

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Cost**|4|8|12|16|20|24|28|
|**Spell Strength**|2|5|10|15|20|25|30|

The caster projects a small (ca. 2cm∅) ball of arcane energy up to [Spell Strength] meters away from themself for 1 minute. The caster can see through the ball as if it were their own eyes. The ball can’t pass through solid objects and can’t move anything it touches. The ball is perceptible, but all vision based tests to spot it have a -20 penalty.

## Restoration

### **Mass Healing**

_“Expensive to cast but worth it for the dejected looks on the enemies faces alone”_

|**Levels**|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
