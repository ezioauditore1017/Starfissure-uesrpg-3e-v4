# Chapter 2: Character Creation

Ah yes, weve been expecting you! Youll have to be recorded before youre officially released. There are a few 

ways we can do this, and the choice is yours.

Socucius Ergalla, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

 
Legendary heroes fill the history of the Elder Scrolls setting, 

but even the greatest heroes need to start somewhere. The 
world of Tamriel is a vast and diverse one, and there are an 
enormous number of potential characters a player may want to 
create. However there are some things that all characters have 
in common, and it is on this common ground that we can start 
to build up a new character.

Step 5: Finishing Touches
Finally, calculate your characters attributes and finalize any 
remaining aspects of the character sheet. Characters also start 
with a budget of drakes which can be used in this step to pur-
chase equipment and other items that the character will begin 
the game with. Once youve fleshed out your character and 
chosen your characters bonds, youre good to go!

Character creation and advancement is accomplished through 
the use of experience points, or XP.

Standard character creation is a five step process. It is neces-
sary to go through these steps in the correct order, and it is 
recommended you read through this list before moving on in 
order to inform your future decisions. When you actually start 
building the character, write down the details from each step on 
a character sheet as you go along so you dont lose track of things.

Step 1: Race
During this step you will choose your characters race. In addi-
tion to  the core playable races from the video games, we have 
also provided various races from the lore in this book. You 
should ask your GM which era the game is taking place in and 
which races are allowed for the campaign before you choose one 
for your character. Each race comes with their own characteristic 
baseline used to generate characteristics for members of that 
race, and many races have bonus powers, starting skills, or traits.

Step 2: Generate Characteristics
During this step you will get to choose your characters favored 
characteristics and generate your characteristic scores using dice 
and the characteristic baseline appropriate to your choice of 
race in the previous step.

Step 3: Determine Birthsign
Next, you determine your characters Birthsign, choosing the 
charge of the Warrior, Mage, or Thief and then rolling on the 
appropriate table. There is a chance during this step that the 
character will receive the Star-Cursed version of a sign instead, 
reflecting the threatening presence of the Serpent sign at the 
time of their birth.

Step 4: Spend XP & Purchase Items
Next, you spend your remaining XP on any character advance-
ments that you desire. Any XP remaining after this process is 
over is kept after character creation.

Step 6: (Optional) Choose Character Traits 
Your GM may instruct you to choose Character Traits from 
the section in this chapter of the same name. Here, you will 
choose positive and/or negative traits using a budget defined 
by the book/your GM. 
optiMizinG CharaCterS

As you create your character, you may have questions about how 
you can make your character function well in the context of 
the game. This section will act as a guide during the character 
creation process to answer those questions.

One of the most important parts of this process is to gather as 
much information as possible, both from your GM and the other 
players. Even if your GM cant give away particular details of the 
campaign, they should be able to give you a sense of the overall 
tone, as well as what kinds of skills will be important to have. 
Its also important to talk to your fellow players, particularly 
while building your characters, so that you can make sure your 
party as a whole is capable of taking on a variety of challenges 
and that each member has an important job to do.

Priorities
When building your character its important to determine what 
your priorities are: what are your characters most important 
traits, and how are you going to represent them within the 
system? Youre working with a limited budget of XP, and while 
you might have an idea of where you want the character to go in 
the future youll likely find that you have to focus on purchasing 
only the essentials at first.

Magically oriented characters should ensure that they have 
enough Magicka Points to support the types of spells they want 
to cast, and a high enough Willpower to reliably cast them. 
The best way to increase ones Magicka Points is through the 
use of the Power Well trait, a trait that increases the amount 
of ones Magicka Points and that can be attained as both a 
racial bonus or through the use of certain Birthsigns. Though 
for some characters there may be no need for lots of magicka: 
a high Intelligence will suffice for an Alchemist or Enchanter.

25

Surviving Combat
Even characters who shine off the battlefield can expect to find 
themselves in combat at least once during a campaign. It is 
important for every character to have a plan when things get 
violent. Perhaps the most important thing to remember when 
approaching combat is to not bite off more than you can chew: 
fighting outnumbered is a very dangerous prospect, even for 
skilled warriors. There are ways to prepare for this situation, 
however: clever use of flanking and long Reach weapons, or 
proficiency in the Evade skill can allow a character to survive in 
combat against many enemies, while heavy armor and healing 
magic can allow characters to last longer under pressure.

Characters who have neither the ability to effectively fight in 
heavy armor, or the speed to dance around their foes, will benefit 
most from simply not getting caught in a direct engagement. 
Characters wielding ranged weapons or using ranged magic can 
have a profound impact on the fight from a safe distance, where 
there is a much lower risk of having an axe buried in ones skull.
Core raCeS

The races provided in this section encompass the core races 
portrayed in the Elder Scrolls games. Additional races can be 
found in Expanded Races on page 42. Each race comes with 
their own characteristic baseline used to generate characteristics 
for members of that race, and many races have bonus powers, 
starting skills, or traits. You should ask your GM which races 
are allowed in the campaign before you pick one. 

Some races have unique racial traits that are defined in their 
sections. Racial powers can be found in the Powers section later 
in this Chapter.

Combat oriented characters should think about how their 
character fights. This means considering both how they plan 
to engage and defeat their enemies in combat, as well as how 
they plan to survive combat.

Characters that arent naturally tough will need another way to 
mitigate damage, either through magical means, the use of armor, 
or evasion. When it comes to winning the fight, its important 
to consider how your character will position themselves relative 
to the rest of the party: having a front line can be veryuseful 
if certain characters intend to engage at range, though these 
front-liners will often find themselves fighting outnumbered.

There are also a wide variety of non-combat oriented characters 
that one might wish to create. There are too many to cover 
here, but in general it is still important to consider how these 
characters will handle themselves if the party gets into a fight.

Skill and Talents
The UESRPG 3e has a large number of skills and talents that 
players can choose from when creating their characters, which 
can lead to some difficult choices. Fortunately there are a few 
general guidelines that players can follow when navigating 
character creation.

When it comes to skills, its important to decide how specialized 
your character needs to be. Mages dedicated to one particular 
school of magic, or warriors devoted to a specific way of combat, 
would both benefit from having a high rank in the relevant skill. 
Rogue type characters, on the other hand, can adopt a more 
jack of all trades approach as they need to be able to navigate 
a wide variety of situations.

There are also a number of non-combat skills that every char-
acter should consider learning, even if only at a very low level. 
Skills like Observe, Survival, Lore, Ride, Navigate, Profession: 
Medicine and Athletics are extremely useful for all types of 
traveling adventurers.

Talents are a little more difficult to choose: there are a variety 
of talents that have very powerful effects, but its easy to go 
overboard. Some talents unlock the ability to do things that 
other characters cannot, while others function to augment a 
particular skill (such as by providing rerolls or replacing degrees 
of success).

The critical decision is which of these abilities are necessary 
to the character, and which are just nice to have. The former 
are worth investing in early, while it is often better to replace 
the latter with additional skill ranks that will prove critical at 
lower XP values.

Altmer
The Altmer (or High Elves, as they are also known) are a race 
of Mer that make their home on the Summerset Isles, a set of 
islands off the south western coast of Tamriel. Many races of 
Tamriel consider the Altmer to be quite beautiful due to their 
fair, golden skinned complexion and the dazzling gem like colors 
of their eyes; as such, the Altmer are welcome guests in most 
parts of Tamriel, save for the Black Marsh and Vvardenfell.  
However, the combination of their fair appearance, long lives, 
propensity for magic, and resemblance to the Old Elves of 
Tamriel tends to give Altmer an elevated sense of their own 
importance. This can sometimes impact diplomatic relations 
with the other races.

The use of magic is heavily emphasized in Altmer society,  given 
the latent magical gifts of the Altmer race. Those Altmer that 
rarely or never leave the Summerset Isles are used to a culture in 
which Magic permeates every level of society. Unfortunately, the 
natural affinity of the Altmer race also leaves them vulnerable 
to magical attack; however, most choose to pay little heed to 
this drawback. Aside from their dependence on magic, Altmer 
also tend to place a high cultural value on living for as long as 
possible, often using magic to extend their longevity. Altmer 
born and raised on Summerset Isle tend to be haughty and 
more out of touch than those raised in other areas of Tamriel.

Argonian
Argonians are a race of reptilian humanoids native to the land of 
Black Marsh in south-eastern Tamriel. In Jel, their native tongue, 
Argonians refer to themselves as Saxhleel (meaning People 
of the Root) to show their absolute reverence towards and 
dependence on a the Hist, a species of sentient trees that share 
a singular and extremely intelligent mind. The Argonian people 
owe the entirety of their life, culture, and shape to the Hist, as 
the sap of the trees is a necessary catalyst for the metamorphosis 
of young Argonians into their humanoid form. Traditionally 
minded Argonians also believe the Hist is a repository for their 
souls, reincarnating them after death.

Argonians are naturally suited to the dangerous environment 
of Black Marsh and are resistant to most diseases and poison. 
Additionally, Argonians have the ability to breathe indefinitely 
while underwater, as well as formidable resistance to many kinds 
of damage, courtesy of the Hist. In their homeland, Argonians 
tend to live in either desolate, scattered villages or within the 
ruins of great cities of stone, remnants of the Elves and other 
extinct denizens of the Black Marsh. Given the necessity of 
the Hist to their lifestyle, most Argonians rarely leave Black 
Marsh by choice; however, some have been known to aban-
don Argonian society and venture out into the wider world 
as adventurers and hired workers. Unfortunately, others are 
sometimes forcibly removed from Black Marsh by slavers and 
sold as chattel across Tamriel.

Bosmer
The Bosmer (or Wood Elves, as they are also known) are a race 
of forest-dwelling Mer native to the province of Valenwood.  In 
their own tongue, the Bosmer refer to themselves as the Boiche, 
or Tree-Sap People, a reference to their pact with the Aedra 
Yffre. Like other elves, the Bosmer were originally from the 
Summerset Isles; however, the Wood Elves scorned strict and 
formal lifestyle of their Aldmeri ancestors, choosing to travel 
to mainland Tamriel and live more carefree and simple lives. 
Chronologically, the First Era is officially marked as starting 
when the Bosmer united under the rule of the King Eplear, the 
first of the Camoran Dynasty. Bosmer are known across Tamriel 
as competent and deadly bow users; some rumors even claim 
that the Wood Elves were the first to have invented and used 
the bow as a weapon.

Despite the high status granted to Auri-El by most of the 
Merish pantheons, the Bosmer hold Yffre in the highest regard. 
As the first of the Aedra to help stabilize Nirn by becoming 
an earthbone, Yffre helped the Wood Elves maintain their 
shape during the Dawn Era. The grateful Bosmer accepted 
his patronage, making an oath known as the Green Pact and 
vowing to never eat nor harm any vegetation that grew within 
Valenwood (though other plants outside the province have no 
such protection). Because of their oath, those Bosmer native 
to Valenwood (and even some who leave) are carnivorous, even 
engaging in cannibalism on occasion.

   (Racial) Beast Tongue: Bosmer can speak to, and under-
stand the speech of, animals. How exactly this functions is 
left to the GMs discretion, though it is recommended the 
GM call for a Perception test when the Bosmer encounters 
the speech of an unfamiliar animal to determine if they can 
understand it and communicate back. Additionally, the 
character receives a +20 bonus to any Profession [Animal 
Training] skill tests they make.

29

Breton
The Bretons are a race of men native to the north western 
province of High Rock. Bretons as a whole are generally dark-
haired, tall and gifted with a rare amount of intelligence and 
willpower compared to the other races of men across Tamriel. 
Despite their height, Bretons tend to have a slighter build, being 
less muscular than Redguards or Nords. Bretons are descended 
from both Aldmeri and Nedic bloodlines, giving them a unique 
combination of abilities that both enhances their innate Aldmeri 
talent for magic and suppresses their vulnerability to magic, 
thanks to their Nedic heritage.  

Culturally, Bretons possess a great love of art and philosophy, 
as well as an innate connection with magic; this leads many 
to scholarly pursuits, becoming great wizards and sorcerers. 
Bretons are also prone to engaging in knightly pursuits, driven 
on by a quest-obsession to do good deeds prevalent throught 
Breton society.

Also worthy of mention are the Reachmen, a splinter group 
of Bretons inhabiting the western reach that joins High Rock 
and Skyrim. Violently opposed to the Breton kingdoms and 
infighting of High Rock, the Reachmen have formed a tribal 
society based on hedge magic learned from Orcs and bird-
witches known as Hagravens. Though far more ferocious than 
their cultured cousins, the Reachmen live far more primitive 
lives, trading the steel blades of High Rock for stone and bone, 
the castles and towers for natural caverns.

Dunmer
The Dunmer (or Dark Elves, as they are also known) are a race 
of xenophobic Mer native to the province of Morrowind,  a land 
dominated by a wasteland of dust and fire. Like other elves, the 
Dunmer were originally from the Summerset Isles; however, they 
are descended from the Chimer, a tribe of Aldmeri exiles who 
fled Summerset to worship the Daedra, whom they title Our 
Stronger, Better Ancestors. An agile and graceful people, the 
Dunmer use their natural magical and physical abilities to their 
advantage in combat. Physically their swordsmanship rivals that 
of the Redguards of Hammerfell, while their natural affinity 
for Destruction magic is rivaled only by their distant cousins 
in the Summerset Isles.

Dunmer society is divided into two distinct areas: the more 
civilized Great Houses and the nomadic Ashlanders. The Great 
Houses of Morrowind behave more like nations than states, 
divided as they are by both culture and politics. The only things 
which unite the Great Houses are the temple and an almost 
universal distaste for outlanders. 

By contrast to the more civilized and political Great Houses, 
Ashlander society is more tribal-oriented and nomadic. The 
Ashlanders split from the society of the Great Houses over the 
validity of the Temples doctrine, a conflict which has divided 
the two sectors of Dunmer society ever since. Those who have 
met the Ashlanders describe them as ferocious, chitin-armored 
savages who are wary of strangers; however, beneath the xeno-
phobic surface of Ashlander society lies a deeply spiritual and 
disciplined lifestyle, a vital key to the survival of the nomads 
in the harsh land of Morrowind.

Imperial
Imperials (also known as Cyrods) are a race of men descended 
from Nedics who settled in the province of Cyrodiil, most nota-
bly Nibenese and Colovians. From the time of the Merethic Era 
the Imperials were held in slavery by the Ayleids (also known as 
the Heartland High Elves) until a Nedic woman by the name 
of Alessia organized a successful slave revolt with the help of 
her champion Pelinal Whitestrake and demigod Morihaus.

Following the revolt, the Cyrods set up three different empires 
under three different factions: Alessia and her followers, the 
Reman Dynasty and the Septim Dynasty. Though the empires 
had internal differences, more stark differences arose between the 
more mercantile Nibenese and the rougher Colovians. Where 
the Nibenese Imperials were skilled at trading the creation of 
wealth, the Colovian Imperials were influenced by their northern 
Nordic neighbors, turning to more physical pursuits such as 
farming and war. In fact, such differences kept the Imperials 
from becoming a unified people until the arrival of Reman 
Cyrodiil in the First Era and Zero Cuhlecain at the end of the 
Second Era.

Due to the central position of Cyrodiil in Tamriel, Cyrods have 
learned to become shrewd traders and diplomats. 

The more Nordic Imperials, Colovians, are rougher and more 
physical than their Nibenese counterparts. The Nibenese are 
more cosmopolitan than their Colovian bretheren and have 
excelled in trade and other such pursuits.

Khajiit
Khajiit are a race of feline humanoids native to the province of 
Elsweyr in southern Tamriel. In their native tongue of Taagra, 
the word Khajiit means desert walkers, a fitting epithet for 
the nomadic race. Unlike the other races of Tamriel, there are 
a variety of different breeds of Khajiit, ranging from bipedal 
to quadrupedal, the size of tigers to the size of house cats, 
and many in between. Some are even unable to speak, while 
others are hard to distinguish from elves. All of these things and 
more are determined by the moons, cementing their place at 
the center of Khajiit society. Aside from determining a given 
Khajiits form and abilities, the moons also form the basis of 
the Khajiits governmental system.

Most Khajiit value agility and cunning above brute force, as 
these traits are valuable assets for survival in the harsh deserts and 
tropical jungles the Khajiit call home. Their natural acrobatic 
ability, intelligence and unmatched agility make the Khajiit 
excellent guerrilla fighters, adventurers and thieves.

Each Khajiit breed counts as its own unique race, but only the 
Suthay-Raht are presented here. Additional furstocks can be 
found later in this chapter.

Suthay-Raht
Similar in height and build to the races of men, the Suthay-raht 
are one of the most common breeds of Khajiit. Their coloring 
ranges from dark brown and orange to light yellow, both with 
and without stripes and spots. Suthay-raht are often referred to 
as JaKhajiit (meaning kitten) by those of other races; this 
appellation often strikes the Khajiit as odd, said title being one 
of their names for Mehrunes Dagon.

Nord
The Nords are a race of tall, fair haired men hailing from Skyrim 
but found all along the coasts of Tamriel. Originating from the 
continent of Atmora, the Nords are a fierce and proud people, 
known for their natural aptitude as both warriors and seafar-
ers. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, Nords 
also enjoy impressive resistance to magical frost and lightning. 
Natural conquerors, the warlike and enterprising spirit of the 
Nords has greatly influenced the history of Tamriel since their 
arrival from Atmora in the late Merethic Era, with their armies 
driving the Snow Elves into ruin and providing the strength 
and impetus to forge the first empires of man. 

The Nords consider themselves the sons and daughters of Kyne, 
formed when the great Northern Winds broke upon the ground 
at the Throat of the World. As such, they consider their breath 
their very essence and some are able to channel their strength 
and power into their voices in magical shouts known as the 
Thuum. 

Honor and heroism are important virtues to a Nord, for they 
believe that an honorable life or a valiant death will grant them 
access to Sovngarde, Shors Hall. This belief makes Nords all but 
fearless in battle, making war with an energy and enthusiasm 
that terrifies their enemies. This leads many down the path of 
the warrior; consequently, most Nords encountered outside 
Skyrim pursue some martial enterprise, be it sellsword, brigand, 
or wandering adventurer.

Orsimer
The Orcs, sometimes known as Orsimer, are barbaric tribes 
found in the north of Tamriel, concentrated in High Rocks 
Wrothgarian mountain range and with settlements in High 
Rock, Skyrim, and Hammerfell. Known for their ugly appear-
ance (including but not limited to green or red skin, prominent 
tusks, and unusual facial bone structure), propensity for violence, 
and skill in metalcraft, the Orcs are commonly held to be the 
least of the races. Although officially accepted as citizens by 
the Cyrodiilic Empire after the events of the Warp in the West, 
Tamriels populace still holds them in low regard, especially in 
the northwest. With the few exceptions of those living in cities 
or camps, most Orcs hail from Orsinium or a Stronghold, where 
they are raised from birth to defend their clan and family.

Orcs have been bred for centuries to survive harsh conditions 
and constant assault, and as such have a natural proficiency in 
hand-to-hand combat. Their sheer physical strength makes them 
formidable opponents when wearing heavy armor and wielding 
two-handed weapons, especially when using products of their 
own design. Most Orcs learn to work metal from a young age, 
and even those who do not choose the smithing profession have 
better skill to maintain their equipment. Orcs hailing from 
wilderness Strongholds are generally more ferocious than their 
Orsinium cousins, who tend to have more skill as craftsmen.

Redguard
The Redguards originated from the continent of Yokuda, far to 
Tamriels west. They are renowned sword masters and forged an 
empire on Yokuda to rival Tamriels own. Following a disaster 
which destroyed most of their homeland, the emigrated east to 
Tamriel, where they landed on Hammerfell. In Hammerfell, 
Redguard society split into two main camps: Forebears, those 
who had come in the Warrior Wave to purge Hammerfell of 
inhabitants, and Crowns, the upper-class who had followed.

The Redguards maintain a strong tradition of sword-mastery 
and honor to this day, though the significant Redguard piracy 
presence suggests interesting definitions of honor. Redguard 
warriors are at their best when using their famed scimitars, 
typically singly with a shield (though there are those who fight 
with two scimitars, known as dervishes). They prefer lighter 
armors and cloth to heavy metal, allowing for freedom and 
rapidity of movement. Redguards make for strong individual 
warriors, though only rarely does one find a Redguard who is 
not part of a society or band. They are known for their strict 
code of battlefield ethics, preferring to fight honorably even 
against creatures they see as below them.

Core raCial variantS

Some exceptional members of certain races deviate from the 
norm due to extraordinary circumstances, which may be cultural, 
societal, or based on their place of origin.

Listed below are several Racial Variants that can be incorpo-
rated into a campaign with the GMs permission. However, 
its essential to carefully consider them, as most of these may 
require the GM to pay extra attention to the cultural changes 
associated with these variants.

Bosmer: The Unglamoured
In the days before the Green Pact, the Bosmer constantly shifted 
between numerous bestial forms, unable to control or maintain 
any single shape. With the assistance of Yffre, they eventually 
acquired the ability to adopt a consistent form, evolving into 
the Bosmer known today. Yet, their original wild nature remains, 
concealed but ever-present.

Most Bosmer show no visible traces of this primal state, their 
true forms obscured by the wild magic of Glamour. This 
Glamour, however, is unpredictable. Some Bosmer lack this 
protective magic, and it remains uncertain whether this absence 
is due to divine retribution from Yffre or merely misfortune.

These particular Bosmer manifest in various formspart mer, 
part beast, satyrs, redcaps, boggles, and other creatures of folk-
loreall marked by entirely black eyes. Within Bosmer society, 
they are regarded with suspicion and caution. Theyre seldom 
found beyond Valenwoods borders, but those who venture 
out quickly realize the broader world is as wary of them as 
their own kin.

Creating an Unglamoured Bosmer follows the basic profile of 
standard Bosmer characters. However, they gain additional 
rules to depict their unique status as shape-shifting outliers:

  (Racial) One With the Wild: Being more in touch with 
the world than their brethren, the Unglamoured have no 
trouble surviving in the wilderness. They receive a +10 
bonus on all Survival tests and gain a +20 on all Survival 
tests relating to the traits chosen on their Wild Shape racial 
trait.

  (Racial) The Beast Within: The Unglamoured are on the 
verge of the Wild Hunt, which can be seen and felt by 
others in their presence. As a result of this uncanny aura, 
Unglamoured receive a -10 penalty on all social skill tests 
and a -20 on all social skill tests involving other Bosmer.

  (Racial) Wild Shape: During character creation, the 
Unglamoured must pick one trait associated with their 
wild shape:

  Amphibious
  Climber (AB x 2)
  Crawler
  Dark Sight
  Natural Toughness (1)
  Natural Weapons (Horns or Claws, 1d6 Slashing or 

Crushing, 1m)

  Natural Weapons (Fangs, 1d4 Slashing, 1m) and  

Strong Jaws.
  Quadruped
  Regeneration (1)
  Swimmer

However, their altered form is also a curse. They must also 
select one weakness:

  Silver-Scarred (2)
  Sun-Scarred (2)
  Weakness (Fire, 2)
  Weak Bones(1)

Breton or Nord: The Reachmen
Before the Nords conquest of The Reach, it was the home of 
a tribal people known as the Reachmen, men and women of 
mixed Breton and Nordic descent. Both Nords and Bretons 
perceive the Reachmen as Mongrels and bloody savages.

Worshipping what they call the Old Gods, taking part in 
blasphemous rituals, utilizing dark magicks and their general 
xenophobic nature makes them feared amongst those that 
oppose them. Their most ill-famed ritual is the rite of the ven-
geance, in which a Reachman has their heart replaced by a Briar 
seed, and infused with a spirit of vengeance to deliver terrible
retribution upon those that stole away their ancestral lands as 
an undead avenger.

They revere and glorify the Hagravens as their cultural leaders, 
a practice that most of Tamriel considers to be foul, or simply 
plain wrong. For these reasons, the Reachmen are regarded 
by most to be a savage people, full of madmen and Daedra 
worshippers.

The Reachmen persistently and unrelentingly battle the Nords 
that rule over them, raiding their settlements when they can, and 
pillaging for the sake of causing chaos. Using the land to their 
advantage, and even the very spirits on their side, they battle 
to take back the Reach. Driven by revenge for the conquering 
of their lands, these men utilize whatever means necessary to 
drive out those that claim the Reach to be theirs.

37

 
Making a Reachman follows the base profile of making any 
Breton or Nord character, representing the mixed blood that 
makes up their numbers, but replaces their usual Racial Traits, 
Powers, and any benefits listed as Other with the traits below:

Making an Ashlander follows the base profile of
making a Dunmer character, but gain the following
Traits and bonuses to represent their harsher lifestyle:

  (Racial) Fury of the Old Gods: The witch-men of the 
reach are blessed by the Old Gods with a righteous fury 
towards any and all invaders, and will not helm until every 
last one of them are dead at their feet. Any social interaction 
test except Intimidation with people not sympathetic with 
the Reachmen suffers a -10 penalty as their native language 
and culture is difficult for outsiders to interpret. However, 
the Reachmen gain a +10 bonus to all Combat Style tests 
made while Frenzied or using the All Out Attack action 
as they fight with the fervor of the Old Gods themselves.
  (Racial) Accustomed to the Profane: The men and women 
of the reach are raised in tribal societies, surrounded by 
profane practices and dark rites, which has tempered their 
wills against the petty horrors of the world. They gain a 
+30 bonus to resist Panic Tests, and a +20 bonus to resist 
Horror Tests.

Other Benefits

  During character creation, a Reachman may choose to 
being with the Survival skill, or one of the traditional hedge 
magics (Alteration, Destruction, or Mysticism) trained to 
Novice rank for free.

  Reachmen do not count as their parent race for the purpose 
of Elite Advances (example: Tongue advance for Nords), but 
can still take the Racial Talents of their parent race found 
later in this book.

Dunmer: Ashlanders
The Ashlanders of Morrowind isolate themselves from most 
of modern Dunmer society, and have become nomads that 
travel the wastes. They are very distrusting of outsiders, and are 
traditionalist in their way of life.

After the Tribunal rose to power directly following the Battle 
of Red Mountain, these Dunmer refused to accept the new 
Tribunal, believing that they betrayed and killed Lord Nerevar 
at the Battle of Red Mountain. They follow the traditional 
old ways of ancestor worship as well as worshipping Daedra, 
specifically Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala.

The Ashlanders were slowly forced into the most
dangerous and inhospitable parts of Morrowind by the
Great Houses. This, their nomadic lifestyle, and their
clan based culture caused them to become more hardy
and adaptable in the hot wilderness around the slopes
of Red Mountain.

  (Racial) Life in the Wasteland: Ashlanders are adapted 
to life in the volcanic grasslands and deserts around Red 
Mountain, and as a result gain a +10 bonus on all Survival 
tests made in hot climates, and count their Resistance (Fire) 
trait as being one point higher while in these environments.
  (Racial) Pride and Prejudice: Any social test except 
Intimidation made by or towards an Ashlander suffers 
a -10 penalty unless the other character is familiar with 
Ashlander customs and traditions. Additionally, Ashlander 
characters should keep in mind that most slights are resolved 
in their society by ritualized duels, often to first blood, 
but sometimes to the death if the perceived insult is grave 
enough to warrant it.

Other Benefits

  During character creation, Ashlanders may choose to 
begin with the Survival skill trained to Novice rank for 
free, instead of Destruction.

Redguard: Crowns and Forebears
While Redguard society as a whole consists of a single race with 
no great bodily variation, a cultural divide between the Crowns 
and the Forebears split their people down the middle.

The people of the Crowns, the old nobility of Yokuda are a more 
aristocratic people, focusing on trade and positive relations, 
while the Forebears, also known as the Warrior Wave or RaGada, 
were the common folk of Yokuda who invaded Hammerfell 
and made it theirs by the sword. In most games, the difference 
will not matter as most people arent affiliated with the politics
between the two factions, but for the games where the difference 
matters, you can choose one of the following profile changes 
and apply it to the Redguard base profile.

Crowns

  The character gains +1 Personality, and -2 Endurance.
  The character replace Combat Style with Commerce or 

Persuade as their free starting skill.

Forebears
  The character gains +1 Willpower, and -2 Personality.
  The character picks one additional weapon for their Combat 
Style at character creation, but it must be a Sword or variant 
of a Sword such as a Sabre or Dagger.

           The Alfiq cannot speak normally, and must communicate 
telepathically. Additionally, the Alfiq does not have oppos-
able thumbs, and will suffer penalties to any tasks requiring 
fine motor skills or grip, such as using a weapon. This is 
left to GM arbitration.

Cathay
The Cathay are similar to the Suthay-Raht in appearance and 
bi-pedalism, however possess greater stature and strength, and 
are often described by non-khajiit races as jaguar-men.

Ohmes
Similar in many ways to the Bosmer, although generally of lesser 
stature. In order to avoid being mistaken as one of the Bosmer 
many Ohmes tattoo their faces to resemble a feline-aspect. The 
Ohmes is the most common form seen outside of the province 
of Elsweyr, taking advantage of other races preference to their 
appearance to serve in positions of ambassadorship and trade.

khajiit furStoCkS

Khajiit are each subtly bound to the Lunar Lattice, a mysterious 
force entitled the Ja-Khajay in their native tongue. The Lunar 
Lattice determines the form a Khajiit assumes in life, according 
to the phases of Masser and Secunda at the time of their birth; 
while Khajiiti newborns appear incredibly similar to one another 
at birth, their future form becomes clear in a matter of weeks. 
This is due in part to the fact that, although born smaller than 
the children of either man or mer, the Khajiiti mature at a 
significantly faster rate.

Rules for playing Suthay-Raht characters can be found in the 
Core Races section on page 33. Below are the rules for cre-
ating Khajiit characters of the major remaining types. Some 
of the redundant variations have been left out, as well as a few 
types that would otherwise be incapable of communicating with 
others or about which we know nothing. Assuming you have the 
permission of your GM, treat these Khajiit just as you would 
any other race and follow the usual steps for character creation.

Alfiq
A quadrupedal form of Khajiit, the Alfiq is, in many respects, 
similar to a common housecat. Although diminutive in form, 
the Alfiq retain the keen intelligence of the Khajiiti, having 
the ability to understand the spoken word of others, although 
unable to respond.

expanded raCeS

This section contains a set of rules for additional playable races. 
Some of these can be used in any campaign, while others only 
have a place in certain adventures. When choosing a race from 
this section, always consult your GM first. Depending on 
when and where your campaign is set, your GM may choose 
to prohibit the use of some or all of these races when you 
are creating a character. The relevant section for each race will 
provide some advice in this matter to help you and your GM 
decide if a certain type of character is appropriate.

The Proto-Races
Between the Aldmer, Atmorans, Nedes, Chimer, and others, 
there are a variety of races that can be classified as proto-races: 
ancestors of one or more of the modern peoples of Tamriel. 
Much of what we know about these races tends to come from 
myths and legends maintained by their descendants, and thus
cannot be taken entirely at face value. On the other hand, the 
Elder Scrolls setting is a strange place, and more often than not 
myths have truth to them. Thus we have decided to leave it to 
individual groups to decide which of these interpretations is 
more appropriate to their campaign. Our general recommen-
dation is to utilize the appropriate modern race as a template 
for their predecessors (Nords for Atmorans, Altmer for Aldmer, 
etc), making tweaks as appropriate. Groups that favor a more 
powerful vision of the ancestral races of Tamriel should feel free 
to tack on points and traits as they see fit, while groups looking 
for a more down to earth game should be able to get by just 
fine with the races found in the Core Rulebook.

The Ayleids
The Ayleids were the descendants of the Aldmer that emigrated 
to Cyrodiil (from Summerset Isle). At one point they controlled 
the entirety of what is now the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, 
and enslaved the indigenous Cyrodilic and Nordic populations. 
These slaves were used in various ways- to build and maintain 
roads and temples and to drain fields. Some Ayleids are even 
said to have tortured slaves for amusement. During the Slave 
Rebellion of 1E 242 the nearby human kingdom of Skyrim 
lent help to their enslaved relatives in the Ayleid Empire, which 
played a part in the Ayleids being overthrown by the Slave 
Queen Alessia and her supporters, and the subsequent shift in 
power from Mer to Men on Tamriel.

It also appears that Alessias rebellion coincided with a civil 
war within the Ayleid Empire which led to many rebel Ayleid 
lords joining forces with Alessia, and aiding her in her rebel-
lion. Though the Ayleids would continue to have a presence 
in Cyrodiil for several hundred years more, they were never 
again a major military or political power. This event signaled 

the beginning of the Late Ayleid Period. Their greatest fortress, 
White Gold Tower, was turned into the Imperial Palace by 
Alessia and her descendants, and it remains so to this day. The 
last of the Ayleids who opposed Alessia held out at a village in 
the vicinity of modern day Bravil and it took Alessias forces, 
led by Bravillius Tasus, four attempts to finally defeat them.

In 1E 393 the Alessian Order sacked the ancient Ayleid temple 
of Malada in their attempts to eradicate all Elven presence in 
Cyrodiil.

Ayleid culture lingered in the city-states that survived as client 
kingdoms of Alessian Cyrodiil, but most of the Elven population 
was finally driven into exile (largely to Valenwood) by the intol-
erance of the Alessian Order, though some Ayleids remained in
Cyrodiil, serving as mentors and tutors for the new human 
nobility. The last remaining kingdom of the Ayleids, Nenalata, 
was last heard of in 1E 482 at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors; 
whether the Kings people made it through the next few centuries 
is unknown, but this was a significant event: the Late Ayleid 
Period was ended, and the Ayleids would never again be seen 
as a military or political power.

It is possible that some tribes of Ayleids may continue to live 
deep within the forests of Cyrodiil even today. Yet the most 
recent reported sightings are more than 1000 years old. These 
Ayleids, or Wild Elves, are at best a rarity and may not have 
actually survived into the Third Era. The Ayleid Sage Tjurhane 
Fyrre talked and wrote extensively of the state of the Ayleid 
culture in the late First Era and early Second Era. According to
Fyrre, the Ayleids of this time lived in a tribal society, with each 
tribe being substantially different from the next.

dotted Tamriel outside Morrowind were mere outposts and 
that there were few significant Dwemer settlements elsewhere 
until 1E 420. The presentation of the Dwemer in fictitious 
but popular novels like the Ancient Tales of the Dwemer has 
also lodged an inaccurate impression of them in the popular 
consciousness, painting them as familiar, comfortable characters 
very similar to humans. In reality, they are better described as 
having been fearsome, unfathomable, and even cruel, though 
also careful, intelligent, and industrious. Their society consisted 
of free-thinking yet reclusive clans devoted to the secrets of 
science, engineering, and the arcane until they mysteriously 
disappeared around 1E 700.

spells used in this way count as if they had the Attack 
attribute instead of the Instant attribute. Additionally, an 
Ayleid can use the Stabilize spell to Treat wounds.

  During character creation, Ayleid characters can choose to 
begin with the Restoration or Enchanting skill trained to 
Novice rank for free.

The Dwemer
The Dwemer, the people of the deep, are a fabled Lost 
Race of Mer from Dwemereth, which mostly consisted of 
modern-day Morrowind, where they are believed to have been 
the most prolific, though they also had a strong presence in 
Hammerfell, High Rock, and Skyrim. Meric races use the term 
Dwemer, which translates to Deep-Elves or Deep Folk. 
Men commonly refer to them as Dwarves. The early history 
of the Dwemer is still clouded in mystery. There is no known 
story of their dissociation from the Aldmer, which must have 
occurred very early in Tamrielic history, as their society bore few 
correlations with that of the Altmer besides some similar legal 
principles. The Dwemer built elaborate underground cities near 
and beneath mountain ranges, including the Velothi Mountains 
and Red Mountain, and in the mountains of the isle Stros 
MKai.

Many misconceptions about them have abounded for cen-
turies: scholars long thought that most Dwemer ruins which

Falmer
The Falmer (or Snow Elves) were once a proud people with an 
unusually great aptitude for magic. They had a strong resistance 
to frost, as their skin was coated with a thin layer of blue-white 
ice. They inhabited Skyrim before the Nords returned from 
Atmora, and were responsible for the Night of Tears. They had a 
civilization which rivaled even the Altmer of the Summerset Isles. 
They had their own language, which was written in a complex 
and nearly indecipherable alphabet. They were purported to 
use spears and archery in Combat.

After the Night of Tears in the late Merethic Era, Ysgramor and 
his Five Hundred Companions launched a campaign to drive 
the elves from Skyrim. Ysgramor and his heirs succeeded, and 
by the second century of the First Era, during the reign of the 
Nordic king Harald, the last of the Falmer were driven from 
Skyrim to the island of Solstheim. The Falmers civilization 
was obliterated at the Battle of the Moesring with the death of 
their leader, the Snow Prince. The remaining snow elves were 
scattered or slain, and were never heard from again.

Unknown to the Nords, many Falmer sought sanctuary with 
the Dwemer of Skyrim. The Dwemer agreed to protect the 
Falmer, but did not trust them. The Dwemer forced their Falmer 
guests to consume a type of toxic fungus found growing deep  
underground which rendered them blind. The Falmer became  
ervants of the Dwemer, and then their slaves. The Dwemer made 
the fungus an essential part of their diet, ensuring that all future 
generations would be as powerless as their current slaves. The 
Falmer were embittered by this betrayal, and rebelled against 
their dwarven masters. They constructed the Great Statue of 
Irkngthand, which contained the Eyes of the Falmer, two 
massive gems embedded in the eye sockets. The Falmer fled deep 
into Blackreach, a gigantic cavern inhabited by the Dwemer. 
Thus began the War of the Crag, a bloody war between the 
Falmer and the Dwemer which took place far below the surface 
of Skyrim. Sai, the god of luck, attempted to help the Falmer, 
likely around this time, but they were very hard to find and 
unfriendly towards him. Mara later condemned the ice elves, and 
considered them gone altogether and forever. In 1E 700, when 
the Dwemer disappeared, the Falmer were left to spread freely 
throughout Blackreach. However, centuries of subterranean 
slavery, combined with their permanent blindness, had left the 
Falmer crippled, and years of fighting the Dwemer had left the 
race bloodthirsty and brutal.

A small handful of Falmer managed to avoid becoming slaves 
to the Dwemer, instead retreating to hidden shrines such as 
the Chantry of Auri-El. These few remaining Snow Elves (as 
they prefer to call themselves) look upon their twisted kindred 
(which they refer to as the Betrayed) with pity. However, these 

sentiments were not shared by the Falmer, as they attacked their 
untainted cousins with the same ferocity that they displayed 
towards the other surface races.

Falmer Player Characters
Below are the rules for creating Falmer characters. Assuming 
you have the permission of your GM, treat the Falmer just 
as you would any other race and follow the usual steps for

The Maormer
The Maormer, also known as Sea Elves or Tropical Elves, are 
a race of mer that reside on the island of Pyandonea, south of 
the continent of Tamriel. They have blank eyes and colorless, 
chameleon-like skin, which is capable of blending in with the 
environment. It was originally believed that they had lived in the 
Altmer home of Summerset Isle and were exiled, but tapestries 
found in the Crystal Tower of Alinor reveal an enmity going 
back so far as to make that theory impossible.

Their leader is an immortal wizard named Orgnum. The 
Maormer practice a snake-like magic which they use to tame 
sea-serpents.

The Sload
The Sload are a race of slug-like beastfolk (hence the name, a 
portmanteau of slug and toad) living in the Coral Kingdoms 
of Thras, southwest of Tamriel.

Sload are innately cautious and careful. In their mythic tra-
ditions, all heroes spend years planning, considering and 
consulting with wise Sload before taking the correct action 
and achieving their goal. By contrast their villains all act quickly 
or rashly and always fail. The Sload language has no word for 
adventure, and
the closest equivalent more accurately means tragic disaster.

Sload apparently do not experience emotions as the Tamrielic 
races do, but are often skilled at acting and may exaggeratedly 
simulate them for the benefit of more emotive beings.

They will honor laws, loyalties and friendships only as long as 
they calculate it to be in their best interests to do so. They also 
have no compunctions against blasphemy, theft, kidnapping, 
murder, genocide or anything else that may help them reach 
their goals. Sload are highly intelligent and have perfect recall of
practically anything they have ever seen or heard. They are quite 
skilled at magic, particularly necromancy and teleportation 
magics.

Sload are apparently not religious in any recognizable sense, but 
will willingly serve Daedra if they benefit from it. Some, in par-
ticular the famed Second Era necromancer NGasta, also follow 
the King of Worms. It is unknown exactly how Sload reproduce. 
They are believed to be hermaphrodites in their youths, though 
the sexual organs seem to be absorbed by the time they are old 
enough to survive on land. Sload parents seemingly have no 
interest in the fate of the young. Upon reaching adulthood the 
Sload becomes amphibious and has an appearance similar to a 
large, vaguely humanoid slug.

While young, adults generally lack many of the skills to survive 
on land. As they age, Sload tend to grow in size and corpulence, 
and many older Sload would collapse under their own weight 
if not buoyed up by water or by magical means. There is no 
known limit to either the age or the size of an adult Sload. 
Understandably, this limits their activities on land.

Generate CharaCteriStiCS

During this step you will choose your characters favored char-
acteristics and then roll for your characteristic scores, using 
the characteristic baseline appropriate to your choice of race.

Choose Favored Characteristics
Not all characteristics are created equal! Some characters excel 
in certain areas over others, beyond a simple difference in raw 
characteristic score. Favored Characteristics are those char-
acteristics a character is naturally gifted in; improving those 
characteristics, or skills and abilities associated with them, is 
easier than usual. Each player can choose their characters two 
favored characteristics  (they must be different characteristics). 
before they generate their characteristic scores. Learning and 
ranking skills (including specializations) or talents governed 
by a favored characteristic, or advancing that characteristic, 
costs 75% of the usual XP cost (round down to the nearest 
multiple of 5). 

Rolling Characteristic Scores
Once you have chosen your two favored characteristics and 
have a characteristic baseline from your race, you can generate 
characteristics:

               Roll 2d10 seven times, and assign each roll to one of your 
Characteristics (excluding Luck). Add each roll to the 
assigned Characteristic score listed in your Characteristic 
baseline.

              Roll 2d10, add 30 to the result, and assign the resulting 
two digit value to your Luck score. Luck cannot exceed 
50 and cannot be advanced.

               If the GM allows it, you may reroll up to three of the sets 
of 2d10 from amongst the pool of rolls (but not the one 
for Luck) after all rolls are completed but before you assign 
the results. The new values are final.

Optional Rule - Point Buy Characteristics 
Instead of rolling for characteristics, with GM permission 
players can instead choose to distribute 80 points amongst 
their various characteristic scores (not including luck, 
which is rolled using the standard rule). No more than 20 
points may go to one characteristic. 

For convenience, all of the characteristics are reprinted here. For 
more information see Defining a Character on page 14. 
Additionally, from this point onward throughout the process 
a player may choose to permanently reduce their characters 
starting Luck score for certain benefits. These will be explained  
when they come up.

Strength (Str / SB) measures a characters physical prowess 
and their ability to employ that prowess and push themselves 
to their physical limits. 

Endurance (End / EB) measures a characters physical health, 
stamina and toughness, and their resistance to damage. 

Agility (Ag / AB) measures a characters physical speed, reflexes, 
and coordination, reflecting their overall ability to move quickly 
and gracefully.

Intelligence (Int / IB) measures a characters mental prowess, 
problem solving, reasoning, ability to recall information, and 
understanding of the mysteries of magicka.

Willpower (Wp / WB) measures a characters mental control, 
resilience, and their ability to control and shape magicka.

Perception (Prc / PcB) measures a characters physical aware-
ness, as well as the accuracy of their gut instincts and intuition.

Personality (Prs / PsB) measures a characters natural charisma, 
presence, expressiveness, and social abilities.

Luck (Lck / LkB) measures a characters good fortune and how 
often events tend to go their way. See Luck in Chapter 1.

deterMine birthSiGn

Next you roll for your characters Birthsign, choosing the charge 
of the Warrior, Mage, or Thief and then rolling a d5 on the 
appropriate table. There is a chance during this step that the 
character will receive the Star-Cursed version of a sign instead, 
reflecting the threatening presence of the Serpent sign at the 
time of their birth. Powers granted by Birthsigns can be found 
in the Powers section later in this Chapter.

Luck 
A player may choose to permanently reduce their 
characters Luck score by 5 in order to choose a Birthsign 
of their choice (10 for the star-cursed version) either 
before or after rolling on the table. Alternatively, if the 
player decides to roll on the table and rolls a non-star-
cursed sign, they can choose to permanently reduce their 
characters Luck score by 5 to take the star-cursed version.

Optional Rule - Player Chosen Birthsigns 
Some groups may not like the random element intro-
duced by rolling for birthsigns. It is acceptable to simply 
pick birthsigns without any Luck cost if the whole group 
agrees to do so.

The Warrior
The Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation and he protects 
his charges during their Seasons. The Warriors own season is Last 
Seed when his Strength is needed for the harvest. His Charges are 
the Lady, the Steed, and the Lord. Those born under the sign of 
the Warrior are skilled with weapons of all kinds, but prone to 
short tempers. 

               Those born under the sign of the Warrior increase their 

SP maximum by 1.

      Star-Cursed Warrior: As above, but also gain 5 Strength 

and lose 5 Willpower.

The Lady
The Lady is one of the Warriors Charges and her Season is 
Heartfire. Those born under the sign of the Lady are kind and 
tolerant.

               Those born under the sign of the Lady gain 5 Personality.
      Star-Cursed Lady: As above, but also gain 5 Endurance 

and lose 5 Strength.

The Steed
The Steed is one of the Warriors Charges, and her Season is Mid 
Year. Those born under the sign of the Steed are impatient and 
always hurrying from one place to another.

               Those born under the sign of the Steed increase Speed by 2.
      Star-Cursed Steed: As above, but also gain 5 Agility and 

lose 5 Willpower or Perception (pick one).

The Lord
The Lords Season is First Seed and he oversees all of Tamriel during 
the planting. Those born under the sign of the Lord are stronger 
and healthier than those born under other signs.

               Those born under the sign of the Lord double their natural 

healing rate.

               Star-Cursed Lord: As above, but also gain 5 Endurance 

and the Weakness (fire, 2) trait.

48

The Stars of Tamriel are divided into thirteen constellations. 
Three of them are the major constellations, known as the 
Guardians. These are the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief. 
Each of the Guardians protects its three Charges from the 
thirteenth constellation, the Serpent. 

The Firmanent

The Mage
The Mage is a Guardian Constellation whose Season is Rains 
Hand when magicka was first used by men. His Charges are the 
Apprentice, the Golem, and the Ritual. Those born under the Mage 
have more magicka and talent for all kinds of spellcasting, but are 
often arrogant and absent-minded.

               Those born under the sign of the Mage gain the Power 

Well (10) trait.

               Star-Cursed Mage: Gain Power Well (25) instead, but lose 

5 Perception, Strength, or Personality (pick one).

another choice if they wish.

               Star-Cursed Ritual: Instead gain all the powers perma-

nently, but lose 5 luck.

The Thief
The Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her Season is 
the darkest month of Evening Star. Her Charges are the Lover, the 
Shadow, and the Tower. Those born under the sign of the Thief are 
not typically thieves, though they take risks more often and only 
rarely come to harm. They will run out of luck eventually, however, 
and rarely live as long as those born under other signs.

               Those born under the sign of the Thief roll an extra lucky 
number that they never lose regardless of their Luck score.
               Star-Cursed Thief: As above, but the character replaces 
their rolled Luck score with 50, gains the Akaviri Danger-
Sense power, and the Running Out of Luck trait. Characters 
cannot spend Luck to choose this birth-sign. Instead, it is 
available as a choice for any character who naturally rolled 
the Thief sign.

The Apprentice
The Apprentices Season is Suns Height. Those born under the sign 
of the apprentice have a special affinity for magick of all kinds, but 
are more vulnerable to magick as well.

The Lover
The Lover is one of the Thief s Charges and her season is Suns 
Dawn. Those born under the sign of the Lover are graceful and 
passionate.

               Those born under the sign of the Apprentice gain the 
Power Well (25) trait and the Weakness (magic, 2) trait.
               Star-Cursed Apprentice:  Gain Power Well (50) and 

               Those born under the sign of the Lover gain 5 Agility.
               Star-Cursed Lover: As above, but also gain 5 Personality 

and lose 5 Willpower or Strength (choose one).

Weakness (magic, 3) instead.

The Atronach 
The Atronach (often called the Golem) is one of the Mages Charges. 
Its season is Suns Dusk. Those born under this sign are natural 
sorcerers with deep reserves of magicka, but they cannot generate 
magicka of their own.

               Those born under the sign of the Atronach gain the Power 
Well (50) trait, the Spell Absorption (5) trait, and the 
Stunted Magicka trait. 

               Star-Cursed Atronach: As above, but gain Power Well 
(75) instead and lose 5 Agility or Endurance (pick one).

The Ritual
The Ritual is one of the Mages Charges and its Season is Morning 
Star. Those born under this sign have a variety of abilities depending 
on the aspects of the moons and the Divines.

               Those born under the sign of the Ritual may choose to 
gain one of the following powers at the beginning of each 
day: Blessed Touch, Blessed Word, Maras Gift. They have 
this power until their next long rest, when they can make 

The Shadow
The Shadows Season is Second Seed. The Shadow grants those 
born under her sign the ability to hide in shadows.

               Those born under the sign of the Shadow gain the 

Moonshadow power.

               Star-Cursed Shadow: As above, but also gain 5 Perception 

and lose 5 Personality or Strength (pick one).

The Tower
The Tower is one of the Thief s Charges and its Season is Frostfall. 
Those born under the sign of the Tower have a knack for finding 
gold and can open locks of all kinds.

               Those born under the sign of the Tower gain the Treasure 

Seeker power and 5 Perception.

               Star-Cursed Tower: As above, but also gain 5 Agility and 

lose 5 Willpower or Strength (pick one).

Youre almost done! All thats left is to calculate your attributes, 
purchase gear, generate lucky numbers, and make any other last 
minute touches. Then youll be ready to go!

Calculate Attributes
The player should now calculate all their attributes based on 
the finalized values of their characteristics. Some of these have 
already been determined. The player should calculate the fol-
lowing attributes and note the values on their character sheet:

             Health Points (HP): Endurance / 2 (round up)
             Wound Threshold (WT): EB + SB + WB
            Speed: SB + [2 x AB]
            Initiative Rating (IR): AB + IB + PcB
            Carry Rating (CR): [4 x SB] + [2 x EB]
             Magicka Points (MP): Intelligence
            Stamina Points (SP): EB
  Luck Points (LP): LB
    Action Points (AP): 3
  Linguistics: IB - 2, to a maximum of 4 (See Languages 

on page 16)

             Size Category: Standard by default

Generate Lucky Numbers
Before finishing off the character, it is time to decide which 
numbers are tied to your fate! Each character has a set of Lucky 
and Unlucky numbers that, when rolled as a result of a test, cause 
a critical success or critical failure (respectively). To generate 
your Lucky and Unlucky numbers, follow these steps:

              A character has a number of Lucky Numbers equal to 
their Luck bonus. Roll 1d100 this many times, rerolling 
any duplicates. These are your Lucky Numbers!

             A character has a number of Unlucky Numbers equal to 
five minus their Luck bonus. Roll 1d100 this many times, 
rerolling any duplicates (and rerolling any of your Lucky 
Numbers). These are your Unlucky Numbers!

If a characters Luck bonus changes later, then convert Lucky 
into Unlucky numbers as appropriate.

Purchase Gear & Equipment
Every adventurer needs equipment! The budget of drakes that 
your character has available to purchase gear before the start of 
the campaign is left to your GM, but we have provided some 
rough recommendations for their use below:

GM discretion

These numbers can vary drastically depending on your cam-
paign. Some legendary games will begin in prisons! It is also 
worth noting that you should run your final gear selection by 
your GM for their approval; simply having enough money 
to theoretically buy something does not mean your character 
could reasonably acquire it. The specifics will come down to 
where your campaign is set and the tone and power level your 
GM wants to set.

51

Fill Out Your Character Sheet
Once you have finalized your attributes and purchased your gear, 
you should finish filling out your character sheet, noting any 
aspects that still need to be finished. Do not forget to fill out 
relevant aspects of the character state, including things gained 
from equipment, magic, encumbrance level (taking into account 
everything the character will be on carrying), and so forth.

Flesh Out Your Character
Despite how much time we spend on them, the numbers on a 
character sheet arent everything. Much of the fun of role-playing 
is creating a character who feels like a believable part of their 
world, but it can often be difficult to decide where to start. You 
can spend as much or as little time on this before your game as 
you like, but its always good to put at least some thought into 
it. The following are a number of questions to consider when 
building any character:

Where Are You From?
This is a critical question, especially in a complex and divided 
world like Nirn. Were you born in your racial homeland? How 
does your character view their birthplace? How were they treated 
there? Would they rather have been born somewhere else? How 
do other people view them in light of where they are from?

What Is Your Family Like?
Are you an only child, or do you have brothers and sisters? 
Whats your place in the family? Are you the eldest and the heir
apparent, or the disowned wild child? Are your parents still 
alive? If not, how did they die?

What Is Your Social Class?
Those in the upper classes seem to have all the advantages, 
but often the greatest heroes come from the lowest of places. 
What part of society did your parents come from? Did they 
pull themselves out of poverty? Are they still there? Or is your 
noble family destitute and on the verge of ruin? How has this 
influenced your life and your goals? How do you view it?

Why Are You Here Now?
What did you do before you came to be in the place you are 
now (or with the party if thats the case) and why did you stop? 
What did you see in an adventuring life?

How Religious Are You?
Tamriel is a place where gods often walk amongst mortals, but 
not all of them are worthy of worship. How devout are you? 
Have you had an important religious experience in your life? 
Or do you believe the gods have abandoned you?

Who Are Your Best Friends and Worst Enemies?
Ignoring the possibility that the other PCs fall into these cat-
egories, who in your life would you call a best friend or worst 
enemy? What happened to make things that way? Where are 
they now? Do you want to see them again?

What Are Your Prized Possessions?
Do you have any Items of sentimental value? Something passed 
down by your family, a friend, or a mentor? You should also 
think about important things youve already lost that you would 
do anything to get back.

Who Are You Loyal To?
Real loners are rare: Tamriel can be a dangerous place without 
allies. Are there people or organizations that you are loyal to? 
What did they do to earn your loyalty?

Yes. Youre in Morrowind. I dont know why youre here. Or 
why you were released from prison and shipped here. But your 
authorization comes directly from Emperor Uriel Septim VII 
himself. And I dont need to know any more than that. When 
you leave this office, you are a free man. 

          Sellus Gravius, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

Bonds
Bonds are short phrases that describe something unique about 
your character personality. They are not necessary something 
that makes you a bad person, but something that can compli-
cate your characters life. Whether its a vendetta, a personality 
compulsion, a large debt, an inconvenient loyalty, or a forbidden 
love, Bonds should be thematic and resonate with your character 
to bring depth and more importantly, interesting and organic 
plot hooks.

Example Bonds include:
 

Ive experienced great loss which I fill by obtaining material 
goods, whatever the cost.

  At the slightest insult to my honor, I find it difficult to 

 

temper my anger.
I have a forbidden lover who I have complicated feelings 
regarding.

  A have taken a vow of pacifism and seek to avoid violence 

whenever I can.
I owe a large debt to an illegal organization.
I am wanted for a crime I didnt commit and seek to return 
honor to my name.
I hold a great grudge against someone who did me wrong 
in the past.
I am prideful and would do anything to protect my image.

Gaining Bonds
During character creation, characters are encouraged
to take a Bond or two. During the course of the game,
the GM may prompt you to clear existing Bonds if they
are resolved, or add new Bonds that arise throughout
the course of the campaign.

Example:

GM: You see the symbol of the Black Heart Cabal on the
corpse. It is unmistakable. How do you react?

Erriana: I place my hand on my heart and say Its a
matter of honour. Ill let no member of the Black Heart
Cabal live.

GM: Okay. Mark down a new Bond: Vendetta against
the Black Heart Cabal.

Exploiting Bonds
If your character is in a situation where your Bonds
will inconvenience, harm, or otherwise make the
situation worse, someone, including you, can Exploit
your Bond by describing how its relevant and offering
a complication. In that case, you get two options:

  Accept the complication and gain +1 Luck Point
 

Spend a Luck to avoid the complication

Example:

GM: An old Cyrodiilic man shakes your hand and tells
you that adventurers are rare these days, and is willing
to help you. The name is Celvus, by the way. Im the
head of this village, he says in a friendly tone. Roll
Observe for me.

Erriana: I pass.

GM: While shaking his hand, you notice a tattoo. The
mark of the Black Heart Cabal.

Erriana: I made swore a vow for vengeance. With my left
hand behind my back I draw a dagger and attempt to
gut him.

GM: You gain a bonus Luck point this session. Roll for
the attack, +20 for surprise.

CharaCter traitS

During character creation, players may take certain traits to add 
flavor to their characters. A character is not required to take 
any traits, but they are recommended. Traits are chosen from a 
preset list. Each trait has an associated Trait Point cost or bonus. 
Character Traits with positive effects (Listed here as Positive 
Traits) incur Trait Point costs, while traits with negative effects 
(Listed here as Negative Traits) provide Trait Point bonuses.

In Character Creation, player characters start with 1 Trait Point. 
Then, players may purchase up to 5 Character Traits by pur-
chasing any combination of Negative and Positive Traits. After 
Character Creation is completed, all remaining Trait Points are 
then lost. However, this is not the end-all be-all for Character 
Traits; GMs may determine that, given some series of events or 
some level of character growth, a player character might lose a 
trait and/or gain another.

Positive Traits
Characters can spend Trait Points in exchange for gaining one 
or more of the following positive traits.

melee and ranged attacks, and other insidious means of harm.

ignore any negative modifiers to Perception for being distracted, 
but not for poor lighting or environmental conditions.

tests involving flexibility, and can perform the Resist Secondary

2 Trait Points
The character is exceptionally average looking, which for better 
or worse makes them harder to remember and recognize. 
Whenever this character attempts to blend in with a crowd 
(that being the general public, or dressed similarly to any group 
in which hes trying to pass for a member by looks alone) he 
gains a +10 to all Subterfuge and Stealth tests made to fit in. 
Additionally when appropriate and at the GMs discretion, any 

character or NPC trying to remember or describe the character 
will either have trouble doing so, such as wrongly describing 
them, or simply being unable to remember them entirely (for 
better or worse).

Negative Traits
Characters can gain the listed Trait Points in exchange for taking 
on one or more of the following negative traits.

Addiction (X)
+2 Trait Points
The character is addicted to some substance, such as alcohol, 
moonsugar, skooma, or even more alien or outlandish drugs 
such as feldew. Should the character not be able to indulge in 
the drug regularly (more accessible drugs require more frequent

in severity by an additional -10 to a maximum of -30 for each 
passing day until they get their fix.

Aversion (X, Y)
+1 Trait Point per Y

54

Weak Immune System (X)
+1 Trait Point per X
The character suffers a -10 * X penalty to Endurance tests made 
to resist contracting diseases when exposed. If the character has 
the Disease Resistance trait, first subtract this value from the 
percentage on that trait. Any overflow is applied to the penalty. 
For example, if a character has Disease Resistance (25%) and 
they take this trait at a 3 X value, then they suffer a -5 penalty 
to their Endurance tests for resisting diseases.

Incompetent (X, Y)
+1 Trait Point per X
The character is particularly bad at something. Pick a skill that 
the character possesses, and choose something related to that skill 
the character would be considered incompetent in, just like you 
would choose a specialty. It must be something general enough 
that the character could conceivably be forced to roll at some 
point and must be a skill that the character has trained to at 
least +0, like Swimming for Athletics (the GM is the final arbiter 
of what qualifies as such). Whenever the character is forced to 
make a roll with the chosen skill that would be affected by the 
chosen Incompetence, gain a -10 penalty to said roll per X.

Low Pain Tolerance
+3 Trait Points
The character has a low threshold for pain, suffering a -10 penalty 
to resist the Shock Test inflicted by Wounds, as well as against 
any Willpower test to resist the effects of pain. Additionally, 
the passive Wound penalty is increased to -30 instead of -20.

+2 Trait Points

they see fit to do so, the GM can call for the character to make 
an Intelligence test in order to not misunderstand a certain 
social situation.

a -20 on Perception based tests that would determine if the 
character is surprised by an enemy or not.

socially related tests in these situations. The character may have 
multiple instances of this trait for different stigmas.

on Willpower based tests to resist Panic tests or intimidation, 
and a -20 penalty on Horror tests.

Ugly
+2 Trait Points

based tests where their appearance plays a major role in the 
outcome.

55

Severe Negative Traits
These negative traits follow the same rules as above, but the 
effects from picking one of these arent necessarily limited to just 
the gaining of Trait Points, so be sure to read each entry carefully.

Choosing any of these traits should only be done after careful 
deliberation (from both player and GM), as they can greatly 
affect the tone and amount of work required by the GM by 
being implemented.

Amnesia
+5 Trait Points
The character has a gap in their memory, they cannot remem-
ber anything that happened during that time period. This is 
something that should be worked out with the GM, and should 
come back to haunt the character.

Blind
+4 Trait Points

However, luck favors the suffering fool, granting them a free 
reroll on any one test not related to their lacking sight once 
per session.

Deaf
+4 Trait Points
Character has the deafened condition while they have this trait. 
However, luck favors the suffering fool, granting them a free 
reroll on any one test not related to their missing hearing once 
per session.

Lingering Injury
+4 Trait Points
The character has an old injury that comes back to bug them 
at the worst times. The GM and the player should work out 
the specifics of the injury, and how it affects the character. 
However, living with a painful injury has made the character 
tough, granting 1 Stamina Point to the character as powering 
through exhaustion and pain is everyday life for the character.

Star Cursed
+5 Trait Points
The character was born beneath an unlucky star and is consid-
ered to be ill-fated. Add 2 unlucky numbers to the character. 
Additionally, things simply tend to go horribly wrong in their 
presence.

Character Names
One of the hardest parts of making a new character can be 
coming up with the right name. In this section weve provided 
a list of sample names for the nine major races pulled from a 
variety of the Elder Scrolls games (which is why the number 
of names varies somewhat between races and genders). Some 
players might simply pick one they like, while others may only 
use them for inspiration. We hope theyll be helpful.

powerS

Powers are magic abilities inherent to certain people that cost 
no magicka, but whose use is limited. They are typically granted 
by virtue of a characters race or the sign under which they were 
born. Some provide passive effects, while others are activated 
abilities.

Adrenaline Rush
The character may choose to gain 1 SP at any time. If the 
character is fatigued when this power is used then remove a 
level of fatigue instead. This SP persists only for that encounter, 
and this power may only be used once until after the characters 
next long rest.

Akaviri Danger-Sense
The character may make a Luck test in order to avoid surprise.

Ancestor Guardian
Each Dunmer is capable of invoking a guardian spirit of one 
of their ancestors and can, through the use of the Cast Magic 
action, bring that spirit into the Mundus to aid them. The spirit 
counts as a ghost (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) 
which, if killed, is sent back to whence it came. Otherwise, the 
spirit persists until 30 minutes pass or until the end of a Combat 
Encounter that it participates in, whichever comes first. This 
power may only be used once until after the characters next 
long rest.

The GM should remember for roleplaying purposes that spirits 
are capable of communicating with mortals, and that Dunmer 
are likely to know the name of their own ancestral spirit. The 
GM should also feel free to customize the profile of the spirit 
beyond that of a generic ghost.

Blessed Touch
This character can speak the word of the divines for an hour 
in order to remove a single wound and all of its effects (not 
including lost limbs) from another character. This also restores 
an amount of HP equal to the amount of damage dealt to cause 
the wound. This character or the target character may choose 
to burn 2d6 Luck to allow this power to also restore lost limbs. 
The target character must remain still for the entire duration 
while the character performs the ritual. This power can only be 
used once until after the characters next long rest.

flee the circle and no characters with those traits may willingly 
enter it unless they can pass a -40 Willpower test (which may 
only be attempted once per round). 
The circle follows the character, but it only remains as long 
as they continue to speak the words and take the Cast Magic 
action each turn. Blessed Word can be sustained for at most 1 
minute (10 rounds). This power can only be used once until 
after the characters next long rest.

The Calling
The Dwemer have developed the capability to form connections 
with the minds of others, allowing silent and instant com-
munication across great distances. A Dwemer may do this at 
any time, though they may not attempt to contact someone 
they have not met. Forming a mental connection requires the 
character to pass a Willpower test or gain a level of fatigue. Once 
a connection is formed the two minds may communicate as 
they see fit. Every minute of communication beyond the first 
imposes another Willpower test, where failure incurs a level 
of fatigue. Alternatively, they may form a connection with a 
number of others equal to their Willpower bonus, but doing so 
causes them to automatically fail the Willpower tests imposed 
by normal communication.

Maras Gift
This character can speak the word of the divines for an hour 
in order to remove a single wound and all of its effects (not 
including lost limbs) from themselves. This also restores an 
amount of HP equal to the amount of damage dealt to cause 
the wound. The character may choose to burn 2d6 Luck in 
order to allow this power to also restore lost limbs. The character 
must remain still for the entire duration while they perform 
the ritual. This power can only be used once until after the 
characters next long rest.

Moonshadow
The character possesses a simple form of innate shadow magic. 
This power may be activated once a day with the use of the Cast 
Magic action. The character becomes Invisible for 18 seconds 
(3 rounds). The character may spend a Luck point, or burn 
one Luck, to extend this duration by one round (this may be 
done as many times as the character desires). This invisibility is 
broken if the character makes an attack, after which it reforms 
at the beginning of the next round as long as there is 1 round 
of duration left. This power may only be used once until after 
the characters next long rest.

Blessed Word
The character may begin speaking the word of the divines 
through the use of the Cast Magic action. This has the effect 
of creating a circle with a radius equal to their Willpower bonus 
in meters. Characters with the Undead or Undying traits must 

Treasure Seeker
The character has a knack for finding treasure and overcoming 
the obstacles that protect it. At any time the character can choose 
to reroll a failed Subterfuge test made to pick a lock or disarm 
a trap, but only once for a given test. This power may only be

used once until after the characters next long rest.

War Cry
Nords are able to call on a very simple form of the Thuum and 
harness it to frighten their enemies in battle. As an action, they 
can issue a mighty war cry that forces all enemies who hear it 
to make a Panic (+30) test. If a character passes this test, they 
are immune to the effects of this power for the remainder of 
the encounter. This power may only be used once until after 
the characters next long rest.
