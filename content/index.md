**Designer's notes**

```
This is an edit I am making for my own groups. The intent here is to have all the rules available in the Rules Compendium and any homebrew changes I make to be all in one place.

## Welcome to the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Role-playing Game

Known as the **UESRPG** for short, this fan-made role-playing game is designed for adventures set in the Elder Scrolls universe.

### Purpose

Rather than focusing on a single era or region, UESRPG takes a _toolbox_ approach. Players and Game Masters (GMs) are provided tools to create their own adventures anywhere in Tamriel—or beyond.

Groups can decide how to use these rules to craft unique stories. While many campaigns may take place during the Third or Fourth Era, the system allows freedom to explore any age or continent.

---

### What’s New in Third Edition

Third Edition polished and streamlined the core ideas of Second Edition, simplifying mechanics, improving balance, and enhancing clarity. The system is easier to learn while staying true to Elder Scrolls lore.

### Lore, Design, and Canon

UESRPG aims to honor the _spirit_ of Elder Scrolls lore while filling in gaps left by the games. The designers built a coherent tabletop interpretation of the setting, reconciling contradictions and gameplay abstractions.

Canon within the Elder Scrolls is intentionally fluid; this system provides a solid foundation that can be adapted to each group’s preferred version of Tamriel.

### Using this Book

This compendium includes all rules needed to create characters and play within the Elder Scrolls setting. It assumes basic familiarity with tabletop RPGs.

Three books form the core of the system: the **Rules Compendium**, **Player’s Handbook**, and **GM Handbook**. Seven supplements further expand the rules: _Arcane Arts_, _Planes of Oblivion_, _Tamrielic Artifacts_, _Secrets of the Dwemer_, _Inhabitants of Tamriel_, _Heroes of Tamriel_, and _Dark Paths_.

## Version 4 Addendum

To preserve the recorded intent and vision of the original designers, Seht’s introduction from the Core Rulebook remains intact. However, many supplements and editions followed, and Version 4 (v4) seeks to unify them.

### An Abridged History of 3rd Edition

The first version of 3e was discovered online and improved through multiple revisions: v2, v3, and the _Black Book of Apocrypha_. These versions expanded upon the Core Rulebook, adding rules for conjuration, necromancy, elite advances, and more.

The community split between v2 and v3 preferences until Greybard and the v4 team began consolidating the system. Their goal was to merge the best aspects of each, returning to the spirit of the original while improving playability.

### The v4 Vision

Version 4 consolidates ten supplements into three books: this **Rules Compendium**, **Inhabitants of Tamriel** (NPCs), and **Tamrielic Artifacts** (relics and magical items). Its foundation is v2 with errata, enhanced by select rules from later editions and the _Black Book_.

### Key Changes & Additions

Major revisions include:

- Reintroduction of **Wound Thresholds** (with an Alternate Wounds option)
    
- Removal of **Armored Spellcasting Penalties**
    
- Restoration of **v2 Action Point Refreshing**
    
- Streamlined **Enchanting** rules
    
- Revised **Bleeding, Disease, Vampirism, Lycanthropy**, and **Shadow Magic** mechanics
    
- Adjustments to spell costs, casting conditions, and balance
