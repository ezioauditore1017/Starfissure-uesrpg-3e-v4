# Chapter 4: Talents & Traits

Like a sudden, violent snow squall that rends travelers blind and threatens to tear loose the very foundations 
of the sturdiest hall, the Snow Prince did sweep into our numbers. Indeed the ice and snow did begin to swirl and churn 
about the Elf, as if called upon to serve his bidding. The spinning of that gleaming spear whistled a dirge to all those 
who would stand in the way of the Snow Prince, and our mightiest fell before him that day.

Skills are not the only way a characters abilities can be mea-

sured. Talents and traits are important parts of any Character.  
Talents are the various unique abilities the character has come to 
possess through training or experience. They include everything 
from passive bonuses to activated abilities and can even modify 
how the character uses certain skills. Traits are rules that reflect 
various natural facts about the character or certain abilities they 
possess, such as the ability to fly or see in the dark.

Learning Talents
The XP cost to learn a talent is based on that talents level. 
Characters must fulfill all requirements for a talent in order to 
learn it. Learning talents governed by a favored characteristic 
costs 75% of the regular XP cost (round down to the nearest 
multiple of 5). 
Core talentS

Most talents have a Governing Characteristic on which 
they are based. Talents governed by one of a characters favored 
characteristics cost less. Some talents have more than one gov-
erning characteristic, in which case only one of them needs to 
be favored to reduce the cost (there is no bonus for having more 
than one of them favored). Some have none, in which case the 
character does not need to meet any characteristic requirements 
and simply pays the base cost.

The following sections divide talents into categories and offer 
descriptions and prerequisites for each. 

Talent Levels
Each talent has an associated Talent Level. Talents of higher 
levels have more powerful effects, as they represent more pow-
erful abilities that are more difficult to acquire. The level of 
the talent determines the XP cost of that talent. The level also 
determines a talents characteristic requirements. A character 
must meet the base characteristic score requirement (unmodified 
by external effects) of at least one of the talents governing 
characteristics before they can purchase it. Some talents have 
additional requirements, which will be listed with those talents. 

If a talent has no listed governing characteristic, then there is 
no need to meet any characteristic requirements and the talents 
cost is always reduced as if it was governed by the characters 
favored characteristic.

Core Talents form the backbone of your characters abilities and 
strengths in the world of Tamriel. Within this segment, youll 
encounter an array of diverse talents that define your characters 
prowess across various aspects of the game. These talents serve as 
the building blocks for your characters combat ability, magical 
aptitude, interactions with the world, and much more.

perceive their environment and glean information about others.

they have the others to fall back on.

the result of shock test. Additionally, any Trident the character 
wields gains the Thrown (5/10/20) quality. If a thrown attack

Panic Test.

or venom. They are above it.
Adept (Any)
The Redguard becomes Immune to Disease, and increases their 
Resistance (Poison) trait by +1.

Adrenaline Burst
Some Redguards revel in the thrill of combat to such a degree that 
their delight numbs them to mortal agony.
Expert (Any), Requires High Men
The Redguards Adrenaline Rush power instead regenerates 2 
Stamina Points immediately, and also heals the Redguard for 
5 Health Points. Additionally, the Redguard ignores all Shock 
penalties from wounds until the Adrenaline Rush expires.

weather. Falmer are immune to all the effects of the blizzard, 
which lasts for 1d12 + Personality Bonus hours, which should be
rolled in secret by the GM.

This section contains Talents for the expanded playable character 
races found in Expanded Races on page 42.

Maormer

Ayleid

Birds of Prey
The Ayleids had a distinct bird motif, respecting their speed and 
predatory nature, but also their nobility.
Adept (Any)
The Ayleid gains +1 to their movement Speed, and additionally 
gains +10 to their Power Well trait.

Lords of the Niben
She Ayleids ruled the Nibenay with an iron fist, and used the power 
of starlight to fuel their night raids on the ancient Nedes, eventually 
enslaving them. All of them.
Expert (Any), Requires Birds of Prey
The Ayleid treats their Willpower Bonus as being 3 higher 
instead of 2 higher when under direct starlight for the purpose 
of the Empowered by Starlight Trait. Additionally, when they 
use the Free Action from Empowered by Starlight, the Ayleid 
can instead choose to regenerate 15 Magicka or 8 Health Points.

Falmer

Born of Ice
The Falmer, or Snow Elves, were dramatically attuned to the cold, 
more so than even the Nords, or the Atmorans that predated them.
Adept (Any)
The Falmer increases their Resistance (Frost) trait by 1. 
Additionally, any Frost enchantments created by a Falmer 
deal a bonus 1 Frost damage (in addition to the bonus from 
Chillhearted Fury), or gain a bonus 1 Frost Resistance.

Legacy of the Snow Prince
The legend of the Snow Prince is the last great tale of the Falmer. 
He conjured a great blizzard and lead a great battle against the 
Nords, and although the Falmer lost, he made good on his pledge 
that many Nords would die that fateful day.
Expert (Any), Requires Born of Ice
Once per Long Rest, the Falmer can spend a Stamina Point 
as a free action to summon a miniaturized blizzard on them-
selves, which counts as a level 3 Frost Cloak that lasts for three 
Rounds. Additionally, as a ritual that must be performed during 
a Long Rest, the Falmer can use 100 drakes worth of ritual 
materials, and spend 100 Magicka Points to invoke a blizzard 
in the immediate region, no matter the climate. The blizzard 
is magical in nature and imposes a -20 on any tests reliant on 
sight (including combat), and additionally counts as dangerous 

Shimmerskin
The Maormers flesh flickers and shifts colour involuntarily, adapting 
to its surroundings with a mind of its own.
Adept (Any)
The Maormer increases their Power Well trait by +10, and 
gains an additional +10 to the stealth bonus gained from their 
Chameleon Skin trait.

Serpent-Sorcerer
The Maormer can form mental bonds with serpents. Their ancient 
magics and high wizards bind great sea serpents to their nobles 
will, but for an adventurer, any snake will suffice as a companion.
Expert (Any), Requires Shimmerskin
The Maormer can, during a Long Rest, perform a ritual requiring 
50 drakes of ritual ingredients, and 30 Magicka Points to attempt 
to permanently bind a snake or serpent-like creature to their will. 
At the conclusion of the ritual, the Maormer and the serpent 
make an Opposed Willpower test, where the Maormer scores
an additional Degree of Success for every additional 30 Magicka 
Points spent on the ritual beyond the first 30. If the Maormer 
is successful, the serpent is bound to the Maormers will, their 
minds effectively fused. The serpent becomes a creature under 
the Maormers control, and gains the Bound trait. The Maormer 
gains the Mindlock (1) trait and has direct control of the snake.

Sload

Baleful Bloating
The Sload is swollen with Magicka. And fat. Lots of fat
Adept (Any)
The Sload increases their Power Well by +10, and gains +3 
Health Points to their HP maximum.

Meticulous Planning
The Sload have no word for adventure. The closest
equivalent term translates to tragic disaster.
Expert (Any), Requires Baleful Bloating
During a Long Rest, the Sload can prepare for all contingencies 
by rolling a number of d100s equal to their Intelligence Bonus. 
Record these results. Each of these numbers can be substituted 
out as the result of any test the Sload, the Sloads target, or the 
Sloads attacker makes before the roll is made. After a number
is used, cross it off, and that number can no longer be used 
during this preparation period. These numbers persist until the 

89

Sload uses all of them, or until they spend another Long Rest 
planning and generating a new batch of numbers.

traitS

Traits are rules that reflect various natural facts about the charac-
ter or certain abilities they possess. They include things such as 
the ability to fly, inherent physical weaknesses, personality traits, 
and so forth. They are typically the result of birth, upbringing, 
or racial circumstance but may be gained through other means 
later in life, though rarely by choice or without the use of magic. 

Traits do not stack unless otherwise specified. If traits with 
an X value are applied to a target with an already existing 
instance of that trait, apply the highest value of X unless 
otherwise specified.

moving through difficult terrain.

Dark Sight
A character with this trait can see normally even in areas with 
total darkness and never takes penalties for acting in areas with 
dim or no lighting.

Dawn-Cursed (X)
Characters with this trait are fatally sensitive to sunlight. While 
in direct sunlight, the character suffers X damage per round 
which ignores all damage mitigation. If the character covers 
themselves completely with clothing and a hood with sufficient 
coverage, this damage is reduced to X per hour in the sunlight. 
If the vampire is under full cover which would block out all 
sunlight, like a fully covered wagon or inside a building, they 
take no damage.

Amphibious
The character can breathe water and ignores the skill cap placed 
on their combat rolls by their Athletics skill when fighting in 
water.

Deaf
The character has the deafened condition while they have this 
trait. See the Conditions section in Chapter 5 for rules on this 
condition.

Bestial
The character has no need to make Survival skill tests in their 
natural habitat, but they must test Willpower to avoid fleeing 
combat if the GM feels that its appropriate (for example, if the 
creature would feel intimidated by its foe).

Blind
The character has the blinded condition while they have this 
trait. See the Conditions section in Chapter 5 for rules on this 
condition.

Bound
This creature is bound by the will of their master. They must 
obey the commands of their master, except they will always 
prioritize defending themselves. Additionally, if the bound 
creature's master or their master's allies intentionally take hostile 
or harmful action against them for any reason, they immediately 
turn hostile and lose the bound trait.
Items with this trait use their creators Willpower score when 
forced to roll any relevant test (except Combat Style). These 
items are practically weightless, counting as having an effective 
ENC rating of 0.

Climber (X)
The character can climb walls and ceilings as if open ground. 
Their Climb Speed is now set to Xm.

Crawler
Rather than walking, a character with this trait crawls. They 
halve their normal Speed (round up) and take no penalties for 

Disease Resistance (X%)
Whenever a character with this trait would be infected by a 
common disease, roll a d100. If the roll is less than or equal to 
X, the character doesnt get the disease.

Diseased (+/- X)
If a character with this trait deals at least 1 point of damage 
after mitigation to another character without with their natural 
weapons, then that character must test Endurance +/- X or 
contract a common disease unless the character already has 
the Diseased trait.

Flyer (X)
The character can fly. They have a Speed equal to X when flying.

Frightening (X)
Those who encounter this character must immediately make 
a Panic (X) test.

From Beyond
The character is immune to the effects of disease, fear, toxins, 
and any mind-affecting magic (i.e. illusions).

Immunity (*)
The character is immune to any effects of the type specified in 
parenthesis. The character may have multiple instances of this 
trait for different effects *.

91

Natural Weapons (Type, Damage, Range)
The character with this trait has unique natural weapons of 
some kind. The Type, Damage, and Range together specify 
the complete profile for the characters natural weapons. This 
overrides the default natural weapons profile and they cannot 
be disarmed. Default Natural Weapons profiles can be found 
in Unarmed Combat on page 104. Natural Weapons cannot 
be enchanted.

Power Well (X)
Characters with this trait have more magicka than usual. The 
size of their Magicka Pool is increased by X. If the character 
would receive this trait twice, combine the X values.

Quadruped
Characters with this trait move up to twice their speed when 
they use the Dash action and three times their speed when they 
use the Sprint stamina ability.

Regeneration (X)
Characters with this trait heal very quickly. They may make 
an Endurance test at the start of each round to heal X HP. 
This does not count as magical healing unless applied by some 
magical source.

Resistance (*, X)
Characters with this trait reduce damage of * type by X after 
any other mitigation and gain a +10 bonus per X to tests made 
to resist non-damaging effects of the listed type.

In cases where a roll is made against one of this character's 
Characteristics, increase that characteristic by 10 * X for the 
purposes of resolving that roll.

Resist Normal Weapons (X)
Characters with this trait are resistant to mundane weapons. 
If the character suffers damage from a weapon/attack without 
the Magic quality, reduce that damage by X after any other 
mitigation.

Running Out of Luck
The characters luck is running out. Whenever they would burn 
any amount of Luck, burn twice that amount. If the character 
does not have this much Luck remaining, just burn all remaining 
Luck.

Savage
The character treats weapons that they wield (including Natural 
Weapons) as if they had the Proven Weapon Quality. If the 
Weapon has the Primitive Quality, then the character treats the 
weapon as having neither Quality. 

92

Incorporeal
Incorporeal characters are spirits, faintly visible and capable of 
moving through objects. They gain the Flyer (Speed) trait and 
may use it to freely move through solid objects. They can be 
targeted by attacks, but they cannot suffer damage except from 
magic damage or damage from attacks with the Magic quality.

Incorporeal characters do not normally affect the world, but they 
can use magic and make attacks that are capable of damaging 
non-incorporeal beings. Attacks from Incorporeal characters 
ignore all AR from any armor that does not have the Magic 
quality and cannot be blocked by shields without that quality.

Natural Toughness (X)
The character with this trait is naturally tough and reduces 
incoming damage of all types by X. This functions like AR for 
the purposes of reducing damage, but it does not count as armor.

Silver-Scarred (X)
Any damage inflicted on a character with this trait after mitiga-
tion by an attack from a silver weapon is increased by X before 
calculating the effects of the damage.
Skeletal
Characters with this trait have purely skeletal forms. Attempts to 
hit them with ranged weapons suffer a -20 penalty. Characters 
with this trait also automatically gain the Undead trait as well 
and are immune to the Burning (X) condition.

Spell Absorption (X)
Characters with this trait absorb a portion of  the magic directed 
at them to fuel their own magicka reserves. Whenever magic 
from another source/character affects them, roll a d10. If the 
value is less than or equal to X, the magic has no effect on them; 
instead, they regain missing MP up to the cost of the magic.

If a character with this trait would be affected by the Reflect 
spell, then the effects of each should be resolved in the reverse 
order to which they were applied.

For example, if a character with this trait has the Reflect spell 
effect applied to them after this trait is applied, then when the 
character is affected by another spell effect they would resolve 
Reflect against that effect first, then Spell Aborption if the effect 
is not reflected.

Strong Jaws
A Bite attack made by this character that deals damage auto-
matically starts a Grapple. The test to contest this Grapple is 
made against the original test made by the attacker. If the target 
Counter Attacks a Bite attack, the Counter Attack ignores the 
creatures AR and Natural Toughness trait.

Stunted Magicka
Characters with this trait do not regenerate magicka naturally 
and halve the benefits (round down) gained from Spell Restraint.

Summoned
This creature or item has been conjured from another plane of 
existence. Upon its death or destruction, it returns to where it 
came from immediately.

Sun-Scarred (X)
Any damage inflicted on a character with this trait after mit-
igation by an attack that counts as sunlight is increased by X 
before calculating the effects of the damage.

If this character is exposed to normal sunlight they lose 1 SP 
each hour. Cloud cover or other such weather halves the rate of 
SP loss. The character must spend an hour in a dark place before 
they can remove levels of fatigue/regain SP lost in this manner.

Swimmer
The characters Swim Speed is doubled.

Telepathy (X)
Characters with this trait can communicate with others tele-
pathically. They are capable of broadcasting thoughts to a 
maximum number of characters equal to their WB within 
a number of meters equal to one hundred times their WB. 
They must have line of sight to the character to whom they are 
broadcasting, unless the target character has this trait as well. 

Characters with this trait can make a Perception test as a free 
action to attempt to locate other characters with this trait within 
their broadcast range, though this test can be opposed by a 
Willpower test if a character wishes to remain hidden.

The strength X of this trait determines the complexity of the 
thoughts they can broadcast.

Thick Skull
Immune to Stun and Dazed.

Vicious (X)
The creature treats their SB as being X for the purposes of 
resolving damage. This does not effect the character's Strength 
Characteristic Score.

Telekinesis (X)
Characters with this trait can move objects with their mind 
within a range of 10 * X meters. This can only be used to move 
fairly small objects (at most a large crate or barrel) at a speed of 
about 1 meter per second (6 per round).

The character can also throw an object at an opponent. This is 
a Primary Action and a Ranged Attack, and it uses Mysticism 
(Willpower) for the test. Any object used in this manner counts 
as an improvised weapon and can only be thrown a distance 
of WB * 2 meters.

93

Terrifying (X)
Those who encounter this character must immediately make 
a Horror (X) test.

Tough (X)
Increase Wound Threshold by X.

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in 
Physical Health on page 109, replace the text for the 
Tough trait with "Character gains a +(10 * X) bonus to 
Shock Tests".

Undead
Characters with this trait are mere walking corpses. They do 
not breathe or require organs to function. They are immune 
to things such as disease, poison, passive wound effects, aging, 
fatigue, and a number of conditions including but not limited 
to dazed, deafened, and organ damage. Use common sense 
when deciding what can and cannot affect characters with this 
trait. The character cannot spend Stamina Points if doing so 
would bring their current SP to below 0.

Undying
Characters are free from most concerns of the living. They are 
immune to disease and the effects of aging.

Unnatural Senses (*, X)
The character with this trait can perceive its surroundings using 
additional and/or different senses than the usual. Their Senses 
allow them to detect the things specified by * within range of X 
meters (even through solid objects). If * is all then their Senses 
have been replaced entirely, and they can simply see normally 
through solid objects up to X meters away.

Weak Bones (X)
Reduce Wound Threshold by X.

Weakness (*, X)
Characters with this trait are weak to a certain damage or effect 
type. They increase damage of * type by X after any other mit-
igation and suffer a -10 penalty per X to tests made to resist 
non-damaging effects of this type.

If this trait would stack for a single damage type, instead only 
apply the highest value of X. Different values of * damage type 
are considered different traits.

In cases where a roll is being made against one of this character's 
Characteristics, decrease that characteristic by 10 * X for the 
purposes of resolving that roll.
