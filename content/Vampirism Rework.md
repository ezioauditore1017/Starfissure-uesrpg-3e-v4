# 🩸 The Curse of Thirst

> _“The blood remembers. The longer you deny it, the louder it calls.”_

---

## ⚙️ Infection

Whenever a creature takes damage from a Vampire’s _Bite_ attack, they must succeed a **–10 Endurance Test** or become infected.  
If they are fed the blood of a vampire, they **automatically fail** this test.

---

## 🧠 The Thirst

Each night at sundown, a vampire must make a **Willpower Test** or suffer **+1 Thirst level**.  
The DC increases by +10 per night since the last feeding.  
Each stage of Thirst replaces the previous one and adds its cumulative penalties.

## ☀️ Sunlight & Mortal Mask

**All Vampire Bloodlines** share the **Mortal Mask** trait, representing their ability to appear mortal when well-fed.

### _Mortal Mask (Universal Vampiric Trait)_

> While Well Fed or Sated, your vampiric nature lies dormant beneath the skin.  
> Your eyes, breath, and heartbeat return faintly. You pass as living to all but divine senses.

- You **do not take Sunlight damage** while Well Fed or Sated.
    
- Detect Life, Turn Undead, and most Divination magic treat you as mortal.
    
- When you become Thirsty or worse, your Mask fades and sunlight burns you again.
