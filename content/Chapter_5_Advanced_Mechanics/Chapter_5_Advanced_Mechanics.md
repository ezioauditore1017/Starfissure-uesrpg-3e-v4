# Chapter 5: Advanced Mechanics

We dont have shields in our culture. It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you dont 

want to get hit, you move out of the way.

Akaviri Potentate Versidue-Shaie, 2920, The Last Year of the First Era

 
In most adventures there is conflict, and this conflict is often 

physical. After all, the world of the Elder Scrolls can be a 
dangerous place. Wars, strange monsters, criminals, mercenaries, 
faction infighting, and any number of other scenarios can all 
force a party to use violence to accomplish their goals, or simply 
force the party into dangerous situations. This chapter contains 
mechanics for resolving combat, as well as other game mechanics 
to handle the variety of situations the players might encounter 
during their adventures.

A Note on Time
The UESRPG divides time into two categories: narrative time 
and structured time. Narrative Time is meant to be used in 
any situations that do not demand the time-sensitive resolution 
of tasks. Functionally this means that almost any non-combat 
situation will use narrative time. In game terms, narrative time 
is a period in which the GM can freely advance time at any rate 
based on the needs of the story and the players. This could mean 
briefly describing the partys long journey across a vast desert, 
or playing out an important conversation minute by minute. 

Structured Time is used to handle time-sensitive events in 
which every second counts and the exact order of actions is 
crucial. Combat almost always takes place in structured time, 
which is what the rules of this chapter are intended for; though 
the GM could decide to handle it in narrative time instead.
CoMbat

The largest unit of structured time is called an encounter. An 
Encounter represents an entire sequence of dramatic events 
that make up a unified block of structured time that may be 
contained within sections of narrative time, or followed up by 
another encounter. Encounters focused on a particular combat 
scene are known as Combat Encounters.

Encounters are broken down into Rounds: periods of time in 
which characters take actions, representing roughly six seconds 
of real time. During a round the GM counts down from 
highest to lowest initiative, giving each character a turn to act 
when their initiative step is reached, until every character has 
had a turn. During a Turn, the active character spends at least 
1 AP to perform an action and resolves its effects. Sometimes 
the rules will refer to initiative steps, which simply refer to 
individual initiative values in the order.

Effect Durations
Effect durations are measured in rounds and end immediately 
after the initiative step on which they took effect. For example, 
if an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their turn, they remains-
stunned until right after the end of their turn 2 rounds later 
(assuming their turn takes place at the same initiative step as 

it did originally).

Combat Overview
Combat encounters can be resolved by following these steps:

Step 1: Determine Surprise
If one or more characters arent expecting an attack, or aware of 
their attackers intentions, they have been surprised. The GM 
should determine which characters count as being surprised for 
the first round of combat. Surprised characters do not roll 1d6 
for initiative; they simply use their Initiative Rating. They also 
may only take reactions until after their first turn has passed. 

Step 2: Set the Scene
Before the characters can begin taking their turns, the GM 
should outline the parts of the scenario that they are aware of, 
including the combatants they face, the positions of everyone 
involved, and the environment theyre fighting in. If the group 
is using a battle map or grid, this would be the time to set it up!

Step 3: Determine Initiative
To determine the order in which characters take their turns 
during each round of the combat, all characters involved must 
make an Initiative Roll. An Initiative Roll is made by roll-
ing 1d6 and adding the characters Initiative Rating. Use the 
characters Initiative Rating and then Luck bonus (meaning 
PCs beat NPCs) to break ties, in that order. Further ties can 
be resolved by contested Luck Rolls or at the GMs discretion. 
The GM rolls initiative for any NPCs involved and should roll 
once for larger groups of similar NPCs. If new combatants 
enter the picture, simply have them roll and take their place in 
the order as appropriate.

Step 4: Round Start
Starting with the character with the highest initiative, each 
character takes one turn. At the start of the round, all char-
acters replenish their AP. Then, during each Turn, the active 
character spends AP to perform combat actions and resolves 
their effects. Once their turn is over, the character with the 
next highest initiative takes their turn. This repeats until all 
characters have taken a turn.

Optional Rule: Turn-Based AP Refreshing 
For an alternative strategic experience, your group 
can choose to play with this variant AP Refreshing 
ruleset. As combat starts, all characters start the 
first round with their Maximum AP. Then, in all 
subsequent rounds, characters replenish their AP at 
the start of their turn rather than at the start of the 
round.

Step 5: Round End
Once all characters have had a turn, the round is over, regardless 
of the amount of AP any characters have remaining. Any effects 
or Conditions that specify a duration of until the end of the 
round end now. 

Step 6: Encounter Ends
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the combat is finished or the event 
that triggered the switch into structured time is resolved.

Mapping Combat
This chapter assumes players are using some sort of grid or battle 
map to track the positions of characters. For ease of use, each 
grid square in such a system should represent a square meter.  
More details on using a combat grid, or advice for playing the 
game without one, can be found later in this chapter.

Action Types
Actions represent all the things that a character can do during 
an encounter. The maximum number of times that a character 
can act during a round is determined by their max AP. All 
non-free actions cost at least 1 AP unless otherwise stated.

Primary Actions can only be taken during the characters own 
turn. They are dedicated combat actions where the character 
is the instigator, and a character may take any number. An 
extended action is an action that requires the use of more 
than one AP, which can cause it to require more than one turn.

Secondary Actions can only be taken during the characters 
own turn or as reactions. They are combat actions that require 
less dedication from the character and can be taken somewhat 
reactively to battlefield circumstances. A character may take 
any number of these. 

Reactions are actions that are taken to counter or resist other 
characters actions or other events that the character is aware of. 
Only one reaction attempt is permitted for each threat or event, 
but any number of reactions may be made per round (provided 
that the character has action points left for that round to spend).

Special Actions are a unique class of actions that are often 
taken in opposition to another character and can be taken when 
a character has gained Advantage in combat. Special actions 
can be either primary/secondary actions or reactions, and they 
follow all the normal rules for an action of their type.

Free Actions can be taken at any time during the combat 
round and cost no action points to activate; though the GM 
should keep in mind what is reasonable for a character to achieve 
in six seconds.

Multiple Action Turns
Because characters can take multiple primary or secondary 
actions on their turn, it is possible that characters can use up 
all of their AP to create some interesting action combinations 
when their turn arises. When declaring multiple actions on 
their turn, the character must declare them individually, 
resolving other characters reactions first before declaring 
and resolving any more.

Movement Budget
A characters Movement Budget is determined by their highest 
speed (usually base speed). During their turn a character can 
move a total number of meters up to their Movement Budget.   
This movement can take place at any point during a characters 
turn, either before or after any actions they take.

Example: a characters Base Speed is 13m and their Climb Speed is 
7m, so their Movement Budget is 13m. They make a standard move 
for 8m, so they can only climb for 5 meters with their remaining 
Maximum Movement unless they use a Dash action.

More details on movement can be found in the Movement & 
Size section.

Primary Actions
The following primary actions are all actions that can only be 
taken during a characters own turn. Unless otherwise noted, 
they cost 1 AP.

Attack
The character can make an attack with a melee or ranged weapon. 
A character may make no more than two total attacks in 
a single round. When attacking they can use one of three 
optional variations of this action. A player must declare if their 
character is choosing one of these variations before the attack 
test has been made.

 

                       All Out Attack (melee only): The character makes a melee 
attack with a +20 bonus by spending an additional AP. This 
is not an extended action.
                    Coup de Grce: The character makes a killing blow against 
a helpless target. A helpless target is one who is either 
unconscious, both restrained and prone, or otherwise phys-
ically incapable of defending themselves. The GM may rule 
that certain characters cannot be killed in this way depend-
ing on the circumstances. This kills the target outright. 
For unarmed Coup de Grce, refer to the Grappling rules.
                     Precision Strike: A character attempting a precision strike 
is aiming to hit a particular part of their opponents body 
and thus suffers a -20 penalty on the attack test. If successful, 
the character may choose the hit location of that attack in 
addition to resolving any other effects the attack would have.

 

97

Disengage
 The character can use this action to retreat from combat with 
an enemy. If they move out of an enemys engagement range 
during this turn then the attack of opportunity reaction or 
other delayed actions/reactions, may not be taken against them.

Cast Magic
The character casts a spell that they know using the rules for 
spellcasting found in Chapter 6. This may be used to cast 
spells that count as attacks, but a character may make no 
more than two attacks in a single round.

Delay Turn
The character declares a set of circumstances in which they 
will act. The character then skips their turn without spending 
AP and may insert their delayed turn into the order as a free 
reaction if the conditions are met. If the delayed turn is not 
taken before the characters next turn would occur, then the 
action points are lost entirely. 

Defensive Stance
Using this action grants the character +10 on any defensive 
tests made until their next turn. Taking this action reduces the 
characters Attack limit to 0 until their next turn.

Secondary Actions
The following Secondary Actions are actions that can be taken 
during a characters own turn or as reactions for 1 AP.

Aim
A character can spend an action aiming in order to gain a 
+10 bonus to their next ranged attack, including spells with 
the Bolt form. This bonus can stack if the character takes this 
action multiple consecutive times before the next ranged or 
bolt attack, but only up to three times for a maximum bonus 
of +30. The chain of aim actions can stretch across rounds. 
This chain is broken and the bonus lost if the character makes 
an attack with another weapon or takes any actions or reactions 
other than to continue aiming or fire the aimed weapon or spell. 
Once the aimed weapon is fired, the bonuses from this action 
are reset to +0.f

Cast Magic (Instant only)
The character casts a spell that they know using the rules for 
spellcasting found in Chapter 6. This may only be used to cast 
spells that have the Instant Spell Attribute.

Dash
The character can use this action in order to move up to their 
speed. If this is done on their turn, this movement is added 
to their base movement for that turn. This action can be used 

to allow a character to move several times their speed during 
a round.

Hide
The character can use this action to attempt to hide from foes. 
If anyone might detect them while they do this, they must 
make a Stealth skill test opposed by the Observe of anyone who 
might spot them. On success, they gain the Hidden condition.

Ready Weapon / Drink Potion
The character may draw, sheath, withdraw, or reload a weapon. 
This action may also be used to drink a potion, assuming it is 
accessible to the character, but this costs 2 AP instead. Some 
missile weapons may require several AP to reload, in which case 
this action must be extended.

Reactions
Reactions can be used at any time during the combat round in 
response to a threat or event that a character is aware of by 
spending an AP. Reactions can be triggered by other reactions: 
if this happens, resolve them however makes the most sense.

Attack of Opportunity
This reaction allows a character to take advantage of an opening 
to make a melee attack (max 2 attacks per round) against an 
opponent when they are vulnerable. Attacks of Opportunity 
are resolved before the action they are being made in reaction 
to is resolved. Any character may use a reaction to an Attack 
of Opportunity without interrupting their current action, but 
they must be able to see their target. An Attack of Opportunity 
may be triggered by the following:

 

 

 

                    Retreat: When an opponent voluntarily moves out of the 
characters melee range without taking the disengage action.
         Approach: When an opponent moves closer to the char-
acter within their melee range (such as from 3 meters away 
to 2 meters away against a 3m range weapon).
                    Spellcast: When an opponent casts a spell within their 
melee range (unless the spell counts as a melee attack).
 Standing Up: When a prone character stands up within 
their melee range without using the Arise action.
      Ranged Attack: When an opponent makes a ranged attack 
within the characters engagement range.
  Ready: When an opponent readies a weapon, reloads a 
weapon, or drinks a potion within their melee range. If 
the opponent does so as a free action, it does not allow for 
an attack of opportunity.

 

 

Block, Parry, Evade
The character tries to defend against an incoming ranged or 
melee attack. See the Attacking & Defending section for details.

98

Counter-Attack
The character attempts to make a standard melee Counter-Attack 
(still subject to the two attack per round limit) in response to 
an attack from an opponent they are aware of through the use 
of their Combat Style skill. See Attacking & Defending.

Free Actions
Free actions can be performed at any time during the combat 
round and cost no action points. They include things like talking, 
signaling, observing ones surroundings, dropping items, and so 
forth. Use common sense when deciding what is a free action.

99

oppose with their Combat Style or Athletics skill. If they win, 
they may move themself and their opponent up to three meters 
in any direction (they must both move in the same direction 
and the same amount) as the character shifts the location of the 
fight. Target character must be within melee range.

Resist
Secondary Action
Character makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test 
which their opponent may oppose with their Athletics or 
unarmed Combat Style skill. If they win, they may escape being 
restrained, grappled, or blinded.

Trip
Secondary Action
Character makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test 
which their opponent may oppose with their Athletics, unarmed 
Combat Style, or Evade skill. If they win, their opponent falls 
prone. Target character cannot be of larger size and must be 
within 2 meters. 

The best techniques are passed on by the survivors.

Special Actions
Special actions reflect unique ways that characters can engage 
in combat, and can be taken as actions of their listed type 
during a combat roll. Alternatively, if a character has one of 
these special actions in their list of Special Advantages (page 
69), it can be used as an advantage instead.

Arise
Secondary Action
Allows the character to use a momentary opening to roll back 
up to their feet, removing the prone condition without granting 
opponents the ability to make an attack of opportunity.

Bash
Primary Action
Character makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test 
which their opponent may oppose with their Athletics, unarmed 
Combat Style, or Evade skill. If they win, their opponent is 
knocked back 1 meter, loses an AP, and must make an Acrobatics 
test to avoid falling prone. Target character cannot be of larger 
size and must be within 2 meters. 

Blind Opponent
Secondary Action
Character makes a Combat Style test which their opponent 
may oppose with their Evade or Combat Style (if wielding a 
shield). If the target loses, they become blinded for 1 round. 
The character must reasonably have access to some way to blind 
their opponent (thrown sand or rocks, for example).

Disarm
Primary Action
Character makes an Athletics or unarmed Combat Style test 
which their opponent may oppose with their unarmed Combat 
Style or Athletics skill. If the target of the disarm attempt loses,  
the character may choose to either take the targets weapon if 
they have a free hand or fling the targets weapon 1d4 meters 
in a random direction. Target cannot be of larger size and must 
be within 2 meters. Cannot disarm natural weapons.

Feint
Primary Action
Character attempts a Combat Style or Deceive test against an 
opponents Observe or Combat Style within a 2m range. If 
successful, they treat their next melee attack against the target 
as if they were Hidden. This effect only applies if the attack 
occurs before the end of the characters current turn.

Force Movement
Primary Action
Character makes a Combat Style test which their opponent may

Attacking & Defending
Combat is resolved as an exchange of blows between two charac-
ters. This exchange is simulated by the Combat Roll, in which 
a pair of attack and defense tests are compared. 

Step 1: Attack
The attacker first chooses their target, weapon, and combat style 
for the attack before making the attack test and applying any 
relevant circumstantial modifiers. Weapons not included in the 
characters combat style are made at the standard untrained 
-20 penalty for all attack and defense tests.

 

 

 

                     Melee Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat 
Style test using either Strength or Agility against a target 
within the range of their weapon.
                     Ranged Weapon Attacks: The attacker makes a Combat 
Style test using Agility against a target within the range of 
their weapon. 
                     Cast Magic Attacks: The attacking caster makes a skill 
test with the skill corresponding to the school of the spell. 

Step 2: Defend
The defender then picks their method of defense and combat 
style before making the defense test. A character must be aware 
of an attack to defend against it, and must choose to defend 
before the attacker has rolled.

 
 

 

 

                     Evade: The defender rolls an Evade test (Agility). 
                     Parry: Melee weapons or shields may be used to parry 
melee attacks. The defender makes the Combat Style test 
using Strength or Agility.
                     Block: Shields may be used to block ranged or melee attacks. 
The defender makes a Combat Style test using Strength.
   Counter-Attack: The characters both attempt to strike the 
other while parrying their opponents blows. The defender 
also makes a melee attack, using the rules above. Both 
characters count as attackers in step 3.

Step 3: Roll Tests & Determine Result
If one character is able to gain a significant advantage over their 
melee opponent, they are said to have gained an Advantage. 
Note that if a defender does not try to defend, or cannot do so, 
they are treated as having automatically failed. 

 
                    Both characters fail: Neither attack nor defense resolves.
  1 character fails: The winner gains an advantage (if melee).
        Attacker wins: The attack is successful, the attacker 
chooses how to utilize their advantage, and resolves it.
      Defender wins: The defense is successful, the defender 
chooses how to utilize their advantage and resolves it.

 

 

        Both characters pass: No characters gain an advantage.
    Attack vs. Block: The defender blocks the attack 
regardless of attacker degrees of success. Resolve the 
block using the rules in Step 4 as if the defender won.

 

      Attack vs. Parry or Evade: The defense is negated if the 
attacker has more degrees of success. Resolve the attack.
 Counter-Attack: Whichever character achieves more 
degrees of success hits the other. If both characters 
achieve the same degrees of success, then neither the 
Attack nor the Counter-Attack resolve.

Critical Success/Failure
If one character critically succeeded, treat it as if they succeeded 
with more DoS than their opponent (if their opponent suc-
ceeded at all). They also gain an advantage. If one character rolls 
a critical failure, and their opponent passed, then their opponent 
counts as having critically succeeded. If one character critically 
succeeds and the other fails, or one succeeds and one critically 
fails, then the character who succeeded gains two advantages, 
which can stack if applicable. If both sides roll a critical success 
or failure, then no advantage is gained, and neither attack nor 
defense resolves.

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in 
Physical Health later in this chapter, then an attack 
resulting in a critical success causes a wound to the hit 
location of the attack.

Step 4: Resolve Attack & Advantages
Finally, resolve the attack based on the result.

Attacker Won 
The attack hits the target and 
deals damage. If the targets 
armor values differ across hit 
locations, then check to see 
where  it  hit  using  the  ones 
digit of the attack roll or a d10 
(count 10 as 0). (You can often 
skip this step entirely or delay it 
until it is necessary).

Next, resolve any advantage gained from the combat roll (see 
the next page). Then roll the damage of the attack and subtract 
the Armor Rating (AR) of the hit location struck. Reduce the 
targets HP by the remaining amount. Some types of AR only 
mitigate certain types of damage. If the damage dealt after 
reduction exceeds the targets Wound Threshold, the attack has 
also caused a wound. See Physical Health for details.

101

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds found in 
Physical Health later in this chapter, then the attack 
instead causes a Wound if it brings the target to 0 HP or 
if the attack is a Critical Success and causes the target to 
take Damage.

              Defender won
If the defender won an advantage, resolve it first:

 

 
 

                     Evade: If an attack is evaded it is negated entirely. The 
character may move up to 1 meter in any direction for free. 
This movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.
                     Parry: If an attack is parried it is negated entirely.
                     Block: If an attack is blocked, roll the damage of the attack. 
If the damage exceeds the shields Block Rating against that 
damage type, then the character takes the full damage to 
their shield arm. Otherwise no damage is taken. Magic 
damage treats BR as half (round up) unless there is a 
magic BR. 

Should there be multiple defenders against a single attack, only 
one defender gains a defensive advantage.

 

 

 

 

Advantage
Characters with advantage may utilize it in the following ways:
                     Precision Strike (attack only): Choose the hit location 
of the attack.
                     Penetrate Armor (attack only): Treat full armor as partial 
and partial as unarmored for the purposes of resolving an 
attack. This does not affect AR.
                     Press Advantage (attack only): Character gains a +10 to 
their next melee attack against the opponent within 1 round.
                     Forceful Impact (attack only): The character can apply 
the Damaged(1) quality to one armor piece or shield on 
the hit location of the attack.
 Overextend (block/evade/parry only): The opponents 
next attack test within 1 round is made at a -10 penalty.
  Overwhelm: Your attack or defense engages your oppo-
nents attention completely. The opponent cannot take 
attacks of opportunity until the attacking characters next 
turn.
  Special Advantage: Immediately take a special advantage 
that is listed in the characters Combat Style. Ignore the 
AP cost, or automatically win any opposed roll involved.

 

 

Unusual Combat Scenarios
There are several odd combat scenarios characters may find 
themselves in. 

Climbing
A climbing character has all of their combat skill tests limited 
by their Athletics skill rank. Characters are limited to fighting 
with a single limb, unless they have extras.

Slippery Surfaces
A character fighting on slippery or wobbling surfaces has all 
combat tests limited by their Acrobatics skill (if they have a 
higher Combat Style rank, they treat it as their Acrobatics rank 
instead). If the character fails a combat roll in these circum-
stances, they must pass an Acrobatics test or fall prone.

Swimming
A swimming character has their combat tests limited by their 
Athletics skill (if they have a higher Combat Style rank, they 
treat it as their Athletics rank instead). Attacks deal half damage.

Holding your Breath
A character can hold their breath for 12 seconds (2 rounds in 
combat) per Endurance Bonus they have.
This duration is doubled if the character does nothing but hold 
their breath (no action or movement allowed).
For every round beyond the characters Endurance Bonus 
holding their breath, the character gains a temporary level of 
fatigue until they die or regain access to fresh air, after which 
the temporary fatigue is removed at a rate of 1 per round.

Swinging or Jumping
A character swinging or jumping into (or out of ) combat has 
their combat tests limited by their Acrobatics skill (if they have a 
higher Combat Style rank, they treat it as their Acrobatics rank 
instead). If the character fails a combat roll they must pass an 
Acrobatics test or fall prone and suffer appropriate fall damage.

102

Melee Combat
Melee combat is any combat that happens within several meters, 
where participants fight either with wielded or natural weapons. 
The melee weapons a character can use are listed as part of their 
Combat Style skills. 

Melee Combat Circumstance Modifiers
Like all tests, tests made in melee combat should always be 
subject to difficulty based on the environment or circumstances 
in which the combat is happening. Disadvantageous circum-
stances can be rated in a simple scale by the GM and should 
not usually be worse than -30. The table below provides the 
scale and some examples.

Melee Combat Circumstance Modifiers

Modifier

Common Examples

Minor Disadvantage (-10)

Fighting in poor visibility.

Disadvantage (-20)

Fighting from lower ground or prone. 

Major Disadvantage (-30)

Fighting blind.

Mounted Combat
Mounted combat functions like normal combat, but with a 
few key differences:

 

     Mounted characters can evade ranged attacks but only while 
moving. They cannot evade melee attacks (except those 
from other mounted characters), though their mount can. 
       Mounted characters may parry or Counter-Attack in 

response to attacks against their mount.
     Mounted characters use their mounts Speed.

 
       The GM may rule that ranged attacks that miss the char-

acter or their mount hit the other target instead.

Multiple Opponents
Facing multiple opponents can be dangerous. While a character 
suffers no direct penalties for doing so, they can soon become 
swamped and run out of action points with which to defend 
themself. Remember that once all their AP for a round have 
been expended the character is treated as having failed their 
defense roll against any subsequent attacks, meaning they 
quickly becomes vulnerable to the others.

Dual Wielding
Some characters fight with two one handed weapons at once as 
a part of their Combat Style and may choose to attack, parry, 
or Counter-Attack with either one.

Cover
Cover is used by characters to obstruct attacks against them, 
either in ranged or close combat. This occurs by either physically 
blocking a blow or by obscuring the exact location of the target.

If the character is incapable of seeing their target, they simply 
cannot attack them unless they have another way of knowing 
that they are there. Otherwise they suffer a circumstance penalty 
to attack targets who are trying to use cover that their attack 
cannot penetrate based on the GMs judgment of the level of 
the cover.

If the target is protected by cover that the attack can penetrate 
with relative ease, the attacker suffers no penalty to hit but rolls 
twice and chooses the lower value for damage.

103

 
Improvised Weaponry
In certain cases a character might find themselves forced to fight 
using improvised weaponry. Attacks with improvised weapons 
suffer the usual -20 untrained penalty unless the characters 
Combat Style includes improvised weapons. The table below 
provides a set of guidelines for the GM.

The GM should feel free to give certain improvised weapons 
appropriate weapon qualities based on the type of object.

Unarmed Combat
Unarmed combat is when a character fights using their natural 
weapons. Characters are always capable of attempting to fight 
in this manner, even if they do not have unarmed combat as 
part of their Combat Style. Characters attempt a Combat Style 
test using Strength or Agility with the standard -20 penalty for 
using an untrained skill, if applicable. 

A characters natural weapons use the profile specified below 
unless the character has the Natural Weapons (*) trait (which 
overrides the default profile). If a character has a Combat Style 
that includes unarmed combat, that skill can be used for attacks 
with the characters natural weapons. Natural weapons ignore 
rules regarding one, two, or hand and a half weapons, and 
cannot be disarmed. Natural Weapons cannot be enchanted.

Parrying/Counter-Attacking while Unarmed
If an unarmed combatant is facing an opponent with a weapon 
with a longer range and they are within their own engagement 
range, then they can attempt to parry that weapons attacks or 
Counter-Attack. Otherewise melee attacks cannot be parried  
or countered by unarmed characters.

Grappling
In place of making a normal attack a character can choose to 
attempt to grapple their opponent. This requires a Combat Style 
test (the style must include unarmed combat) opposed against 

either a Combat Style (with unarmed), Athletics, or Evade test. 
On success, the target gains the restrained condition. The target 
may attempt to escape by using the resist action. On success 
they break free. 

Characters suffer a -30 penalty when attempting to grapple 
characters of larger size than them, and they cannot grapple 
characters of two or more sizes larger. While they have an oppo-
nent restrained, the character may not move but may take the 
following actions (each is a primary action that costs 1 AP):

 

 

   Takedown: The character may render their victim, and 
themself, prone. They suffer no prone penalties in relation 
to any tests made against their target.
   Move: The character may move themself and their victim 
a number of meters up to their Strength bonus in any 
direction.

     Attack: The character may make a normal attack against 
their restrained victim, who cannot defend themself. They 
must use a weapon with a 1m range or less. If the target 
is both prone and restrained and the character is armed, 
this can be a coup de grce. If the character is unarmed, 
then they can choose to instead cause the target to lose 1 
Stamina point.

Ranged Combat
Ranged combat is any form of combat that happens at a distance 
with weapons which must be shot, thrown, or slung at their 
target. The ranged weapons a character can use are listed as part 
of their Combat Style skills.

Ranged attacks are resolved similarly to melee attacks, except 
they cannot be parried or Counter-Attacked. Ranged attackers 
cannot gain or utilize advantage. Ranged weapons have  unique 
attributes that distinguish them from melee weapons:

Range for ranged weapons is defined in terms of three numbers 
instead of just one, representing the maximum close, effective, 
and long ranges of the weapon. Attacking targets in close range 
provides a +10 bonus to attack tests with the weapon, while 
attacking targets at long range imposes a -20 penalty.

Reload represents the number of AP required to reload a 
weapon which fires ammunition. This requires the use of the 
ready action.

Ranged Combat Circumstance Modifiers
Like all tests, tests made in ranged combat should always be 
subject to difficulty based on the environment or circumstances 
in which the combat is happening. Disadvantageous circum-
stances can be rated in a simple scale by the GM and should 
not usually be worse than -30. The table below provides the 
scale and some examples.

Ranged Combat Circumstance Modifiers

Modifier

Common Examples

Minor Disadvantage (-10)

Firing in light wind

Disadvantage (-20)

Firing in moderate wind, target prone

Major Disadvantage (-30) Firing in heavy wind or low visibility

Firing while Mounted
A character can use ranged weapons even while mounted, how-
ever their Combat Style skill is limited by the Ride skill of the 
personal controlling the mount (if their Combat Style rank 
exceeds their Ride skill rank, use their Ride skill rank instead). 

Area of Effect Attacks
Some ranged attacks, typically spells, affect an area. Area of 
effect attacks that cause damage can only be defended against 
by evading or blocking and only if the character is aware of the 
incoming attack. 

On a successful Block, the character halves the incoming damage 
(round up) before resolving the effects. On a successful evade, 
the character may move a single meter in any direction as normal 
without provoking any Attacks of Opportunity. If this would 
carry them outside the range of the area of effect, they are not 
affected.

Area of effect attacks are resolved against the body.

Combat Example
This page contains an example of a short combat exchange using 
the rules discussed thus far:

The Scene
Deep in a frozen cave in the northern reaches of Skyrim, a lone 
hero squares off against a mighty troll. The hero is lightly armored, 
wielding only a simple broadsword and shield.

Round 1
Both characters roll initiative. The troll rolls an 8, and the hero 
rolls a 12. Both characters have 3 maximum Action Points.

The hero has the first turn, and moves forward a few meters so that 
they are within their two meter melee range (determined by their 
broadswords range stat) of the troll. They decide to take the attack 
action (1 AP), against which the Troll reacts by Counter-Attacking 
(1 AP). The hero rolls a Combat Style [Nord Champion] test with 
a +30 bonus (for a TN of 75) due to their rank in the skill. The 
troll also rolls their own attack test. 

The hero passes with 4 degrees of success (roll of 43), and the troll 
passes with 2 degrees of success (roll of 26). No advantage is gained, 
but the hero is able to land a hit as the two exchange blows (due to 
rolling higher DoS). They resolve the effects of the hit against the 
trolls body (due to the 3 in their roll) and rolls damage. The troll 
takes a total of 8 damage from the strike.

both characters have spent 1 AP. It is still the Heros turn.
The hero decides to press the attack, and makes another attack, this 
time they go all out (2 AP for an All Out Attack, giving them a +20 
bonus to their attack) and the troll attempts a Counter-Attack (1 
AP). The hero makes a mistake and opens themself up, failing their 
attack test while the troll still manages to roll 6 degrees of success (roll 
of 61) on their attack test. Because the hero failed while the troll 
succeeded, the troll not only lands a blow but gains an advantage. 
The troll utilizes this advantage to knock the hero to the ground, 
taking the trip special action and auto-winning the opposed roll 
to render the hero prone (this costs 1 AP). They then resolve the 
damage from the hit, and the hero takes 9 damage from the blow.

At this point the hero is prone, is out of AP, and their opponent is 
also out of AP. The round ends, and a new round begins...

Round 2
The hero takes the first turn, having higher initiative. They use 
half of their total speed in movement in order to stand up, and 
the troll takes advantage of this opening to make an attack of 
opportunity (1 AP). The hero is injured, and so opts to play 
defensively, raising their shield in an attempt to block the attack 
(1 AP). The troll passes their attack test with 4 degrees of success, 
and the hero passes their defense test with only 3, but this is still 
enough for them to interpose their shield between their body 
and the blow. The troll rolls damage, and the 8 damage is not 
enough to overcome the BR of the heros shield, so the blow slides 
off harmlessly... 

At this point one character has attacked, and the other reacted, so 

The hero, now standing, presses the attack...

Running Smooth Combats
This page provides some visual examples to help players under-
stand how they might utilize battle grids and other tools to 
make combat run as smoothly as possible.

Using a Grid
The creators of the UESRPG highly recommend the use of a 
battle map or grid when running combat encounters. A grid 
helps players to understand their own situation, assists the GM 
in keeping track of the big picture, and makes understanding 
the consequences of combat ranges much easier.

The easiest way to use the UESRPG with a grid is to assume 
that each grid square represents a square meter. Two characters 
cannot share the same grid square, though characters can be 
allowed to pass through another characters square if both parties 
are willing. The system also functions just fine on a hex grid.

If you are using an online grid or map system that supports 
auras (as displayed in the example pictures) then using auras 
can be a good way to help players visualize their weapon ranges.

Tracking Initiative & AP
One of the trickiest parts of running combat can be tracking 
how much AP a given character has remaining for the round. We 
advise GMs track this by simply tallying next to each character 
(PCs and NPCs) name on an initiative ordered list/table each 
time that character takes an action or reaction. This allows the 
GM to easily see who can still react and who has AP left with 
which to take a turn.

Visuals Examples
Above, the red mercenary wields a 2m range weapon (yellow 
aura) outside the 2m range (green aura) of the blue mercenary. 
They then move into the edge of their opponents range. Both 
mercenaries can attack the other at this range.

Below, the red mercenary wields a 1m range weapon at the 
edge of the 3m range of the blue mercenary. Stepping any 
closer triggers an opportunity attack from the blue mercenary, 
but doing so is necessary for them to enter melee range (right).

phySiCal health

During the course of the players adventures, it is very likely 
that they will suffer injury of some kind. The following sections 
explain how to handle damage, fatigue, wounds, and death.

Damage & Hit Locations
Damage represents the ability of an attack to harm a character. 
Attacks against a character always strike a particular hit location, 
and the damage of that attack is reduced by the Armor Rating 
(AR) of that hit location. The Hit Location of an attack is usually 
determined by the 1s digit of the attack roll, but can also be 
determined by rolling 1d10 (counting 10 as 0). The characters 
Health Points (HP) are then reduced by the remaining amount.

Damage Types
The above rules hold true for all physical attacks and physical 
armor. However, some attacks and effects can deal other types 
of damage that can only be resisted with certain types of armor.
Broadly, damage can be divided into two overall types:

Physical Damage
Physical damage represents physical cuts, jabs, and blows that 
harm a character through force of impact or blood loss (or 
both). All normal weapons deal physical damage, and physical 
damage is reduced by normal AR.

Magic Damage
Magic damage represents damage dealt by magical or elemental 
forces, such as burns from a fire ball spell. Poison is included 
in this category, though it is not always magical. There are 
sub-types of magic damage, each reduced by a corresponding 
armor type (and also reduced by generic magic AR).

Resolving Magic Damage vs Specific Damage
When resolving specific damage types against resistance or weak-
ness traits, the more specific value for the trait takes precedence.

For example: Jefe (pronounced Geoff) of the imperial guard is 
fending off a horde of zombies as they fall upon the city gates. 
Zombies have Resistance (Magic, 1) and Weakness (Fire, 3). Jefe 
successfully casts Fire Bolt and rolls 5 for damage. When the spell 
affects the zombie, the Weakness (Fire, 3) trait is applied to the 
damage without applying the resistance to magic resulting in a 
total of 8 fire damage being applied.

Death
If a character is reduced to 0 Health Points remaining, then 
they fall unconscious. A character who is unconscious at 0 HP 
must pass an Endurance test at the end of each of their turns. If 
they fail a number of tests in excess of their Luck bonus while 
unconscious, then they die. Taking damage at least once causes 
the character to fail the next test. If an effect would Stabilize 
them (this can be done with a Survival or Profession [Medicine] 
skill test and a healers kit) or bring them above 0 HP, then 
they stop testing.

Youre not gonna kill me! 

Lokir of Rorikstead, moments before death

Wounds
Wounds represent devestating injuries caused by more damaging 
attacks, and not just simple cuts and bruises. If a character ever 
takes damage from a single attack in excess of their Wound 
Threshold (WT), then they take a wound. Record the amount 
of damage and hit location, then follow these steps:

Shock Effects
First, the character must make a special Endurance test known 
as a Shock Test, which represents how well the character fares 
against the initial effects.

 

 

            If the wound is to the body, the character loses an action 
point. If they have none remaining, they begin the next 
round with one less. If they fail the shock test then they 
also suffer the crippled body condition.
     If the wound is to a limb, the character suffers the crippled 
limb condition (blows to the head instead stun for 1 round). 
If they fail the shock test, then they also suffer the lost limb 
condition (lost ear or lost eye for the head).

If the wound was caused by magic damage, the following applies:

109

 
 
 
 

 

 

           If the wound is from fire damage, the character also must 
pass a Strength or Agility test or gain the Burning (1) 
condition.
    If the wound is from magic, frost, or poison damage, the 
character also loses a Stamina point.
    If the wound is from shock damage, the character also loses 
Magicka points equal to the damage inflicted.

Optional Rule Note: Turn Based AP Refreshing 
If youre using the alternate ruleset for AP refreshing, 
modify the text in the body Shock Effect from they 
begin the next round with one less to they begin their 
next turn with one less.

Passive Effects
After the shock test has been resolved, the character suffers a -20 
to all tests and a -2 to future initiative rolls until the wound is 
fully healed. The character has 30 seconds (5 rounds) before they 
drop to 0 HP through blood loss. These effects can be removed 
by first aid (a Survival or Profession [Medicine] skill test must 
be performed, which takes 1 turn and requires a healers kit or 
other supplies), or delayed with magical healing (see below).

Optional Rule: Alternate Wounds 
If your group prefers less bookkeeping and a more 
forgiving experience, you can use this rule instead of the 
standard rules for Wounds: 
Instead of a character taking a Wound when they take 
damage in excess of their WT, they take a wound if  they 
ever take damage from a critical success on an attack or if 
an attack reduces them to 0 Health Points.

Healing
There are two means by which characters can heal damage and 
wounds which have been dealt to them: natural healing, and 
magic healing. 

Restoring HP
Both magical and natural healing can restore missing HP. 

Magical Healing
Magical healing will always specify an amount of missing HP 
that it restores, and this happens instantly unless otherwise noted. 

Natural Healing
Characters naturally regenerate a number of missing HP equal 
to their Endurance bonus each time they take a long rest as long 
as they have no untreated wounds. This amount is doubled if 
the character is not doing anything strenuous and is focused 
entirely on healing themselves (or if another person is caring 
for them).

Healing Wounds
In order for a character to begin to heal wounds, those wounds 
must be treated first. If a wound is not treated within a number 
of days equal to the characters Endurance bonus, the charac-
ter becomes Maimed: any body parts crippled by the wound 
become crippled permanently and count as being lost.

Healing Untreated Wounds
Characters cannot regenerate HP naturally while they have 
untreated wounds. In addition to restoring HP, magical 
healing done while the character is wounded temporarily 
removes the passive effects and forestalls unconsciousness for 
a number of rounds equal to the amount healed. If a charac-
ter ever heals to full HP while they have an untreated wound, 
they become maimed as the wound has healed improperly.

Treating Wounds
A wound can be treated by a successful Profession [Medicine] 
test, which takes approximately an hour. Once a characters 
wound(s) have been treated, they can begin to heal naturally 
again. Treating a wound related to the Crippled Condition can 
only be done once per long rest. If this test results in a dramatic 
failure, the limb immediately becomes Maimed.

Curing Wounds
Once a wound has been treated it can be properly healed. After 
treatment if a character regenerates HP (by magical or natural 
means) equal to or in excess of the damage that caused the 
wound, then the wound and all of its effects are removed. The 
one exception is that characters cannot heal lost limbs in this 
fashion.

Conditions
Conditions are things that externally affect the character and 
their capabilities instead of features of the characters nature. 

Bleeding (X)
Reduce Wound Threshold by 1. At the end of the characters 
next turn, they take X damage (bypass AR/resistance); then X 
is reduced by 1. If the character regains HP from any source, 
subtract the total HP regained (including HP that would go 
beyond the characters maximum HP) from X.

Bleeding can also be reduced by making a Profession[Medicine]  
+0 skill test and using a Healers Kit. Reduce X by the DoS of 
the test. The Healers Kit is not consumed in the process.

If X ever becomes 0, the Bleeding condition is removed.

If the Bleeding(X) condition would be inflicted on a character 
that already has a Bleeding condition, the value of each is added 
together and replaces the current Bleeding condition.

110

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If your group is using the optional rule for wounds, 
replace the text Reduce Wound Threshold by 1. 
with Characters take a -10 penalty to Shock Tests..

Deafened
The character loses the ability to hear. Deafened characters 
cannot hear anything and automatically fail tests that rely on 
hearing.

Blinded
The character loses all vision and suffer the following penalties:

                     Cannot see anything.
                     Suffers a -30 to tests benefitting from sight.

 
 
                       Automatically fail any tests that rely solely on sight.

Burning (X)
The target is engulfed in flames, with the intensity of the fire 
determined by a number X. 

 

 

 

 

                     Start of Turn: At the end of each of their turns, a burning 
character suffers a single hit of X fire damage to the appro-
priate hit location (body is the default). Then increase X 
by 1.
                     Stacking Burning: If a second instance of burning is 
inflicted on a character, simply combine the two X values.
                     Taking Action: A burning character must pass a Willpower 
test with a -20 penalty at the beginning of a turn in order 
to attempt any action other than putting out the fire.
                     Putting It Out: A burning character can attempt to extin-
guish the flames on their turn by spending an action point 
and making an Strengrh or Agility test with a +20 bonus 
and a -10 penalty for every point of the X value beyond 
1. The burning character becomes prone and, if the test 
succeeds, loses the burning condition.

Chameleon (X)
A character with this condition blends into their environment. 
Sight based tests to detect this character are made with a -X 
penalty. Only apply the highest value version of this condition 
if a character would receive it more than once.

Crippled Body Part
A piece of the characters body has been rendered temporarily 
useless. Multiple instances of this condition can affect a character 
at once as long as each affects a different hit location and/or 
the body parts associated with that hit location. Any body part 
that has been crippled suffers all the same penalties as if it had 
been lost. Use Lost Eye or Lost Ear if the head location has 
been crippled and the Organ Damage condition if the body 
location has been crippled.

Dazed
The character gains one less action point at the beginning of 
each round, to a minimum of one.

Entangled
The character makes all Combat Style tests with a -20 penalty 
and their movement speed is halved (round up).

Fatigued
When a chracter gains a level of fatigue, they acquire the Fatigued 
condition. If they gain additional levels of fatigue, the effects 
worsen. Fatigue is most typically gained when a character falls 
below 0 SP or spends/loses SP when they are at 0.

Frenzied
The character is flung into an uncontrollable rage. Frenzied 
characters gain the following rules:

 

 

 

 

 
 

                     Must attempt to attack the nearest person or creature in 
melee combat each turn if able, using only All Out Attacks.
                     If not within range of a potential target, the character must 
move toward the nearest potential target. They may not 
attempt to flee the fight.
                     Increase WT by 3 and SB by 1.

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds, disregard 
the WT increase in this bullet point.

                     Suffer a -20 penalty to all skill tests based on anything 
except Strength, Agility, or Endurance.
                     Gain an extra SP, which can exceed their SP maximum.
                     Immune to the effects of the stunned condition, fear, and 
passive wound effects.

Once the encounter has ended, the character snaps out of their 
frenzied state and loses 2 SP (this cannot kill them). The charac-
ter can also test Willpower at a -20 as an action during combat 
to attempt to snap out of frenzy, which ends the condition.

Hidden
The character is hidden from enemies and moving stealthily. 
Characters must spend 2 meters of their movement for the 
round for each 1 meter that they actually move while hidden, 

111

and they cannot Dash. Enemies cannot attempt to defend 
themselves against the attacks of hidden characters, but attacking 
causes a character to lose this condition immediately afterwards.

If a hidden character would enter line of sight of at least one 
character from whom they have not previously hidden, they 
must make a Stealth test opposed by that characters Observe. 
On success, or if they achieve more degrees of success, they 
remain hidden. Otherwise that character becomes aware of them.

Immobilized
Immobilized characters cannot move. They may still attack and 
take other actions and can defend themselves.

Invisible
Invisible characters cannot be seen. Characters fail all sight 
related tests related to spotting the Invisible character and 
attack them at a -30 penalty, assuming they can guess where 
the character might be in the first place.  

Lost Body Part
The character loses a part of their body. A character can have 
multiple instances of this condition at once, each affecting a 
different body part. If an attack would hit a body part that has 
been entirely lost, the attack hits the body location instead. This 
condition applies additional penalties that vary based on the 
body part. In the case of the head, there is a choice between  
an ear or an eye (GMs decision).

Lost Ear
The character has had their ear removed or destroyed and their 
hearing damaged. They suffer the following penalties:

                      All tests that rely on hearing are made with a -20 penalty.
 
                    If both ears are lost, the character gains the deafened con-
dition permanently.

Lost Eye
The character has had their eye removed or destroyed and suffers 
the following penalties:

                      All tests that rely on sight are made with a -20 penalty.
 

                    If both eyes are lost, the character gains the blinded con-
dition permanently.

Lost Foot/Leg
The character has had their leg severed somewhere between the 
ankle and the hip and suffers the following penalties.

                    Gain the slowed condition permanently.

 
                      All tests that rely on the use of two legs are made with a 

 

-20 penalty.
                    If both legs are lost, gain the Immobilized condition per-
manently and fail any tests that rely entirely on movement.

Lost Hand/Arm
The character has had their arm severed somewhere between 
the wrist and the shoulder, and suffers the following penalties:
                    Can no longer use two-handed weapons, shields (if the 
whole arm is missing), or one handed weapons in that arm.
                      All tests that rely on the use of two hands are made with 

 

 

a -20 penalty.
                    If both hands are lost, the character cannot wield weapons 
and automatically fails all tests that rely on the use of hands.

Organ Damage (Lost Body Part: Body)
The character has had their internal organs damaged. Characters 
with this condition heal damage at half speed and reduce their 
SP maximum and WT by 1.

Optional Rule Note: Alternate Wounds 
If youre using the rules for Alternate Wounds; instead of 
reducing WT by 1, increase the passive wound penalty to 
all tests to -30.

Muffled (X)
A character with this condition is harder to hear. Hearing based 
tests to detect this character are made with a -X penalty. Only 
apply the highest value version of this condition if a character 
would receive it more than once.

Prone
The character is prone, and every 1 meter that they move while 
prone costs 2 meters of their movement for the round. They 
also suffer a -20 penalty to all combat related tests and count 
any full armor they are wearing as partial (to represent that it is 
easier for characters to take advantage of gaps in their defenses 
while they are down). 

Dropping prone costs no movement, but standing up requires 
that a character spend movement equal to half of their base 
Speed. If the character does not have this much movement 
left over to use, then they cannot get up unless they take the 
Arise action.

Paralyzed
The character is frozen, unable to move any part of their body. 
They may only cast spells that do not require speech or motion.

Restrained
The character is restrained and thus unable to move. They also 
cannot attack or defend themselves. They may only cast spells 
that do not require motion.

Silenced
Magically silenced characters believe they are making sound, 
but in reality their words never pass their lips. They suffer the 

112

usual -20 penalty for being unable to speak when casting spells. 
At the start of each round they can roll a Perception test to see 
if they realize what is happening.

Slowed
The characters Speed is reduced by half (round up).

fear
When a character is confronted by an excessively frightening 
event or adversary, they must make a Fear Test. There are two 
types of fear tests: panic and horror tests. If the character fails 
the test, they succumb to the effects of fear. 

Stunned
The character immediately loses all remaining action points 
upon becoming stunned. Stunned characters do not regain 
action points at the start of each round.

Your GM may call on you to make a Panic Test when you are 
confronted by mundane shock or horror. This is represented 
by the Panic (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test 
with a +/- X modifier.

Unconscious
The character is knocked out and loses consciousness. They fall 
prone if the circumstances allow and may not take actions. If 
a character gains a level of fatigue while unconscious, they die.

Your GM may call on you to make a Horror Test when you 
are confronted by supernatural terrors. This is represented by 
the Horror (+/- X) notation, which is simply a Willpower test 
with a +/- X modifier. In general, horror tests with any sort of 
penalty should be reserved for the most terrifying monsters and 

mind melting terrors.

Fear Effects
If in combat a character fails a fear test, they must immediately 
roll a d100 on the appropriate table on the next page. The effects 
listed are applied immediately to the character. 
If in a non-combat situation the character fails a fear test, the 
character becomes unnerved and suffers a -20 penalty to any 
tests that requires concentration on their part. This penalty 
lasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the object 
of their fear. 
Characters may be able to shake off some of the effects of fear 
after the initial shock has worn off. The table below will specify 
certain cases where a character can make a Willpower test when 
it is their next turn to snap out of their fear. Snapping out 
of the fear always happens at the end of their turn.
If this succeeds, then they regain their senses, shrug off the 
effects, and may act normally from then on. If they fail this 
test, the effect continues, and they may try again when it is 
their next turn.

they struggle to reassess the situation. They may not make any reactions until the beginning of their next turn.
Spooked: The character gets the shakes from the source of their panic. Fretting, nervous, and full of doubt, they 
suffer a -10 penalty to all tests for the rest of the encounter unless they snap out of it.
Frightened: The character is taken aback, and their teeth clatter in their skull as they inch back from the source of 
their panic. The character cannot willingly approach the object of their fear, and they suffer a 10 penalty to all tests 
until the end of the encounter.
Lost Composure: The character loses their nerve and freezes in place. Their will to act is decimated by the stress on 
their mind from the source of their Panic. The character may take no actions until they snap out of it. After snap-
ping out of it, the character will make all tests at a 10 penalty for the rest of the encounter.
Running and Screaming: The character breaks down with fear and flees. They must immediately flee directly away 
from the source of their fear as fast as they can, which includes ditching equipment slowing them down. They must 
do everything in their power to accomplish this and is at a -20 penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, they 
must successfully snap out of it to regain control, or the encounter must end.

Momentary Blackout: The character is so overcome with horror that their mind fails them for a few precious 
seconds in the face of this horror. The character drops to the ground unconscious for 1 round and has a -10 penalty 
to all actions afterwards for the rest of the encounter.
Uncontrollable Vomiting: The characters own body reacts with a gut wrenching sound as the characters innards 
empty themselves, and they start vomiting uncontrollably. The character bends over and vomits for 1 round and is 
considered helpless during this time. Afterwards the character is still nauseous and loses 1 Stamina point immediately.
Manic Terror: The Characters mind cracks like a fragile glass sculpture, and they begin to laugh maniacally. Turning 
upon the closest nearby friend or foe they start attacking them with whatever weapon they have in their hands at 
the moment. The character can attempt to snap out of it at the start of their first turn each round or be knocked 
unconscious to stop their manic rampage. Afterwards the character loses 1d4 Stamina points immediately. 
Hopeless and Despairing: The character falls to the ground and cries out in despair and terror while shutting out all 
other sounds, babbling and mumbling to themselves for comfort for 1d6 rounds. When they regain their senses they 
immediately lose 1d4 Stamina.
Blackout: The characters mind snaps like a twig, unable to truly process the horror of the situation and collapsing 
instead. The character goes catatonic for 1d4 hours and cannot be roused by normal means during this time. 
Mind Break: The characters will bends as their mind shatters. They drop to the ground while stuttering and 
mumbling incomprehensibly for 1d6 rounds. The characters mind is irrepressibly damaged, and they lose either 1d8 
Willpower or Personality (players choice) permanently from the harrowing experience. Afterwards for the rest of the 
encounter the character cannot attack or approach the source of horror.
Scared to Death: The character is so immeasurably overcome with terror and horror that their heart stops beating; 
they must make an Endurance test or die on the spot. Should they succeed, they instead fall catatonic for 1d4 hours 
as with Blackout.

MoveMent & Size

This section contains more detailed rules for movement, and 
creatures of larger sizes.

Movement
During their turn a character can move before or after taking 
their action (or both), though they may not move further than 
their Speed in meters during a single round unless they take 
the Dash action.

Difficult Terrain
Sometimes terrain can be more difficult to traverse than usual, 
like when trudging in water, through a forest, or other similar 
terrain. Moving through Difficult Terrain doubles the cost of 
movement, unless the character passes an Athletics or Acrobatics 
test before moving.

Swim Speed and Climb Speed
Moving while climbing or swimming underwater uses a char-
acters Climb Speed or Swim Speed respectively. Both speeds 
are half of their Base Speed (round down) unless otherwise 
specified by a talent or other ability.

Jumping
A character may also make an Acrobatics test to jump over or 
up to an obstacle, either horizontally or vertically. This can 
represent either completely clearing the obstacle or just jumping 
high enough to grab it with both hands, depending on what the 
GM feels is appropriate. If the character does not spend several 
seconds running or otherwise preparing (approximately a round) 
before the jump, then they suffer a -10 penalty to the test.

When jumping vertically, each meter they wish to jump beyond 
the first imposes a -20 penalty on the test. When jumping 
horizontally, each meter they wish to jump beyond the first 
imposes a -10 penalty on the test. Critical Failure results in the 
character tumbling to the ground. 

Falling
Falling inflicts 1d10+[meters fallen beyond 2] damage to the 
body. This damage ignores armor.
If a character falls 2m or less and is in control of their body 
when falling (not tied, paralyzed, unconscious, surprised, etc.), 
they do not take any damage from the fall.

Size
Tamriel is home to creatures of many shapes and sizes. A char-
acters size affects them in a number of critical ways. There are 
seven different size categories. 

     Puny: This category is reserved for the smallest of creatures 

like kwama foragers, rats, or mice. 

     Tiny: This category includes smaller characters like cats 

or large cave rats. 

     Small: This category includes everything ranging from 
quadrupeds like wolves to smaller bipeds like goblins. 
     Standard: Standard sized characters fall fairly close to the 
average size for man or mer. There are no effects associated 
with this category.

     Large: This category includes characters that are substan-
tially larger than average, including quadrupeds like horses 
and larger bipeds like trolls. 

     Huge: This category includes very large characters such as 

giants or larger dwemer constructs. 

     Enormous: This category is reserved for extremely large 

characters, like dragons.

diSeaSeS

Diseases are contracted from contact with diseased people, 
diseased animals, or other creatures which are filthy; such as 
skeevers or mudcrabs. Sometimes diseases can be caught as 
the result of traps, poisons, or environmental effects, such as 
Corprus.

Considerations When Using Diseases 
Some groups love diseases, as they add opportunity for 
adventure and adversity for their characters, as well as pro-
vide a level of realism to their games. They are also useful 
to make characters with skill in Profession [Medicine] 
and resistance or immunity to disease really shine. Other 
groups might find diseases to be too much to track and 
only useful to add dramatic effect. Others still might 
decide to ignore them altogether. 

Its up to your group and the GM to discuss and decide 
how much of this ruleset to implement for your game. 
However, keep in mind that some diseases can be 
particularly nasty and might ruin the fun for a player if 
they completely cripple their character with no satisfying 
resolution. For this reason, GMs should take care in how 
they implement this ruleset and make sure to provide 
some realistic or interesting path to a cure when needed.

Contracting a Disease
Diseases are contracted after an encounter with a creature with 
the Diseased (+/- X) trait or a magical/environmental effect.

In an encounter with creatures, a disease has a chance of being 
contracted when an attack from a Diseased creature causes a 
wound. The target of the attack must then successfully test 
Endurance +/- X or contract the creatures disease. In an encoun-
ter with an effect (magical, environmental, etc), the effect will 
determine when Endurance is tested to contract the disease 
and at what difficulty.

Common Diseases
Common Diseases are caught most often from traps, poisons, 
or from fighting Diseased animals or people. Common Diseases 
are often spread through contact or bodily fluids, preventing 
them from breaking out into full blown plagues.

Common Diseases bear mild social stigma, which can escalate to 
disgust and suspicion in extreme cases. Given the ease of treating 
Common Diseases, only the truly destitute and unfaithful are 
afflicted with what is seen as their just due.

Shared Effects of Common Diseases
All Common Diseases cause the following effects in their victims:

  Diseased (+0)
 

  Gain the Social Stigma (1) Character Trait

All Common Diseases can be cured by using any spell level Cure 
Disease spell or potion. Any Common Disease can also be cured 
by sincere repentance and piousness at a shrine to one of the 
Eight and One. Infected animals typically ignore the effects of 
the Common Diseases they carry.

The Diseases include a d100 result in case you want to random-
ize Disease contraction without regard to which creatures are 
typically carriers.

After contraction, a common disease takes effect after the charac-
ter takes a long rest or the next morning, whichever comes first.

Ataxia
d100: 1-10
Ataxia is a common and relatively mild disease found across 
the breadth of Tamriel. Its symptoms include general pain and 
soreness, muscle stiffness, and anemia. Victims of Ataxia are 
often pale, groggy, and irritable because of their symptoms. 
Some particularly devious bandits and trap-makers are known 
to spring vials or lace nails with the bodily fluids of dead animals 
that carry the disease.

Symptoms:
  Drain Agility 5 pts
  Drain Strength 5 pts

Brain Rot
d100: 11-15
Brain Rot is a progressively worsening, mind affecting disease. 
It dampens the intelligence, intuition, and mental acuity of its 
victims. Eventually, Brain Rot destroys any semblance of sanity 
and of the self in its victims, leaving them to shuffle in a broken 
stupor until they are cured or die.

Symptoms:
  Drain Magicka 15 pts
  Drain Intelligence 15 pts
  Drain Personality 15 pts

Carriers: Cave Rats, Zombies, Hagravens, Traps

Bone Break Fever
d100: 16-20
Bone Break Fever is a particularly cruel disease. Carried primarily 
by rats and bears, the disease aggressively attacks the victims 
bones until they are vulnerable and prone to breakage. Untreated 
Bone Break Fever often results in crippled or outright severed 
limbs because of the fragility it causes in its victims.

Symptoms:
  Drain Strength 10 pts
  Drain Endurance 10 pts
  -10 to Shock Tests

Carriers: Cave Rats, Bears, Wolves

Blood Lung
d100: 21-24
A relatively minor, non life-threatening illness, Blood Lung 
causes bleeding cysts in the victims lungs. They are prone to 
rupture at inconvenient times or times of physical exertion. 
While Blood Lung is not severe, and will not typically worsen, it 
does open the door for other diseases to take root, and can also 
serve as a vector of infection for others via the coughed up blood.

Symptoms:
  Drain Endurance 5 pts
  Gain 1 level of Fatigue
  Every SP used inflicts the Bleeding(1) condition

Carriers: Cave Rats, Nix-Hounds

Black Heart Blight (Common)
d100: 25-28
Black Heart Blight, despite being a member of the Blight family 
of diseases created by Dagoth Ur, is a both a blight and a 
common disease and is less severe than its cousins. After the 
ending of the Blight in 3E 427, Black Heart Blight survived 
after making the jump to undead. It is carried by zombies 
exclusively after the destruction of Dagoth Ur, but prior to 
their death it was also carried by the various blighted beasts 
or Corprus monsters of Morrowind. It is an acute disease that 
saps the victims vitality and endurance. This is the Common 
Disease version.

Symptoms:
  Drain Endurance 10 pts
  +1 Encumbrance Level

Carriers: Zombies

Chills
d100: 29-32

The Chills are a punishing infection caused by contact with the 
undead. Its other symptoms include an overwhelming sensation 
of cold that is not affected by the warmth of any fire nor the 
light of the sun. It has lead to the death of many an unfortunate 
adventurer  lost, alone, and cold in the crypts that dot Tamriel.

Symptoms:
  Drain Intelligence 20 pts
  Drain Willpower 20 pts
  Drain Agility 20 pts
  All tests suffer a -10 penalty

Carriers: Zombies, Bonelord, Bonewalker

soreness.

Symptoms:
  Drain Agility 10 pts
  Drain Endurance 10 pts
  Reduce Max AP by 1

Carriers: Zombies, Shalks

Dampworm
d100: 36-40
Dampworm is a parasite that infests the victims musculature, 
slithering in between the tissue. It can be felt occasionally 
moving underneath the skin, which is a revolting and disturbing 
experience to say the least. Its symptoms include minor twitches 
and lapses in gross motor skill, as well as uncontrollable sweating.

Symptoms: Reduce Speed by 2

Carriers: Nix-Hounds, Horses, Falmer

The Droops
d100: 40-50
The Droops are a notorious and serious Common Disease that 
result in weakened and exhausted muscles. They result in exces-
sive fatigue after virtually any physical exertion.

Symptoms: 
  Drain Strength 5 pts
  +1 SP cost to all Stamina abilities

Carriers: Zombies, Sheep, Kwama

117

Red Fever
d100: 66-70
A notorious and common illness, Red Fever often hits during 
late autumn or through contact with wild wolves or dogs. The 
fever is short lived but intense, causing intense sweating, fever, 
vomiting, and often other unpleasant bodily functions. Red 
Fever is known to put even the mightiest warrior into fits of 
anguish for its brief, but hellish, duration.

Symptoms: 
  Succeed a -40 Encumbrance test or become completely 
disabled (but still conscious) by the violent symptoms of the 
disease for 24 hours

Carriers: Wolves, Dogs, Cave Rats

Additional Effects: After three days, this disease is automatically 
cured.

Rockjoint
d100: 71-80
Rockjoint is a pervasive and ubiquitous disease across Tamriel. 
Every adventurer, noble lord, or peasant farmer has either had 
Rockjoint or has personally known someone with Rockjoint. 
Rockjoint swells the knees and elbows with sensitive and painful 
fluids that bloat and then stiffen and can lead to total immobility 
if left unchecked.

Symptoms: 
  Drain Agility 20 pts
  Reduce StrB by 1

Carriers: Guar, Alit, Wolves, Cave Rats, Bears, Horkers, Foxes, 
Traps, Zombies

Frostlimb
d100: 51-52
A relatively obscure Disease, Frostlimb causes intense sensations 
of coldness within the victims arms and legs, especially their 
fingers. As a result, fine motor skills are punished greatly, and 
the effect of Frost damage is greatly magnified.

Symptoms: 
  -10 to all tests that require fine motor skills
  Gain Weakness (Frost, 3)

Carriers: Trolls, Mammoths, Falmer

Greenspore
d100: 53-55

ing fungus that causes irritability and mild dementia. The spores 
take root in the victims mind but are easily treated in the early 
stages. Mature Greenspore can cause permanent brain damage.

Symptoms: 
  Drain Personality 15 pts

Carriers: Slaughterfish, Zombies

Helljoint
d100: 56-60
Helljoint is a mild inflammatory disease that causes swelling 
of the joints and mild irritating pain. It is extremely common 
in northern climates and is easily contracted. Luckily, it is just 
as easily cured.

Symptoms: 
  Drain Agility 10 pts

Carriers: Zombies, Cliff Racers, Wolves

The Rattles
d100: 61-65
The Rattles is a mild disease of subtle nervous ticks. The Rattles

though the sufferers of the disease arent aware of their ticks 
unless paying deliberate attention.

Symptoms: 
  -10 to Agility tests that require fine motor skills
  Drain Willpower 10 pts

Carriers: Cave Rats, Nix-Hounds, Chaurus, Zombies, Skeletons

118

Rust Chancre
d100: 81-82
Rust Chancre is a mild disease that affects the victims skin. 
Blistering, itchy rashes break out in random patches across the 
victims body, often including their face and neck. The crackled 
rashes are quite off-putting to others and irritating to the sufferer, 
but ultimately it is not a threatening disease. Rust Chancre often 
leaves permanent scarring after it is cured.

Symptoms: 
  Drain Willpower 5 pts
  Gains the Ugly Character Trait

Carriers: Cave Rats, Zombies, Traps

Additional Effects: After curing Rust Chancre, the affected 
character must pass an Endurance test or add the Ugly Character 
Trait permanently.

Tunnel Cough
d100: 91

miners and other cave divers and dungeon dwellers. It is char-
acterized by dry, hiccup-like coughs. The coughs are not painful 
or debilitating but are certainly an inconvenience.

Symptoms: 
  -20 to all stealth tests

Carriers: Caused by exposure to ore dust

Witbane
d100: 92-98
Witbane is an acute Disease that affects the victims memory 
and magicka. Its symptoms are largely varied in their exact 
execution, but minor memory loss and confusion are common 
across all cases. It is not degenerative.

Magical Diseases
Magical Diseases are like common diseases in that they can 
be contracted from infected creatures or effects, but they are 
supernatural or magical in origin. Unlike common diseases, 
magical diseases are much harder to cure and can cause lasting 
or even permanent effects on the afflicted character.

The social reaction to magical diseases is often more extreme 
due to their unusual physical symptoms, which are beyond 
those of common physical illnesses.

Blight Diseases
The greatest, and most obscure, threat is the Blight, a mysterious 
weather-like phenomenon emanating from the crater of Dagoth Ur, 
warping and poisoning creatures in its path, and creating diseased 
horrors that attack travelers and outlying settlements.
- Berela Andrano

Blight diseases are native to Morrowind and originate from 
Dagoth Ur and his Blight storms which he unleashed on 
Morrowind from deep within Red Mountain in the late second era. 

Shared Effects of Magical Diseases
All Magical Diseases cause the following effects in their victims:

These diseases come in two forms; those which cause the host 
to waste away, shutting down their internal biology, and those 
which result in grotesque growths on the subjects body.

Stage One

Stage Two

Stage Three

- Diseased (+0)
- Social Stigma (1)

- Diseased (-15)
- Social Stigma (2)

- Diseased (-30)
- Social Stigma (3)

Magical Diseases can generally be cured by any effect (commonly, 
spells or potions) which specifies that it cures magical diseases, 
unless otherwise stated.

All magical diseases have a Disease Progression section which 
defines how the disease will progress through its stages.

Astral Vapors
Those who suffer from Astral Vapors find themselves weaker 
to the effects of magic and have their magicka reserves sapped. 
The Afflicted are often surrounded by magical fungal spores and 
may suffer from minor hallucinations and a general malaise.

Symptoms (all 3 stages): 
  Weakness (Magic, 3)
  Stunted Magicka
  Drain Magicka 20 pts

Carriers: Dread Zombies

Each blight disease is presented with an entry for its gestation, 
which is a combination of a duration and a difficulty modifier. 
After the disease is contracted, the character makes an Endurance 
test after the duration has passed with the listed modifier. If 
they fail this test, the disease progresses to the next stage and 
the duration of the gestation period is reset. On a success, the 
disease does not progress and the character must retest at the 
start of the next day.

Ash Woe Blight
Ash Woe Blight is an acute blight disease affecting the victims will 
and thought processes. It may be contracted from corprus beasts or 
other blighted creatures.
Gestation: 4 days, -10
Stages:

Stage 1: Lose 10 Willpower and Intelligence
Stage 2: Lose 15 Willpower and Intelligence
Stage 3: Lose 20 Willpower and Intelligence

Ash Chancre
Ash-Chancre is an acute blight disease affecting the victims behavior. 
It may be contracted from corprus beasts or other blighted creatures.
Gestation: 4 days, -10
Stages:

Disease Progression:
The effects of each subsequent disease stage take hold after the 
character takes a long rest or at the next dawn; whichever comes 
first.

Stage 1: Lose 10 Personality
Stage 2: Lose 15 Personality
Stage 3: Lose 20 Personality, Gain the Frenzied condition 
until  cured

120

Two. After each success, the next endurance test increases its 
penalty by 5 as the pain of the wound increases and the wound 
begins to fester.

Once they have progressed to Stage Two, the character continues 
making increasingly difficult Endurance tests, but now starting 
at +0 and increasing in penalty by 10 per success as the festering 
of the wound grows.

During Stage Three, resisting the diseases progression becomes 
nearly impossible. During Stage Three, resisting the diseases 
progression becomes nearly impossible. The character continues 
to test Endurance each dawn, starting at no penalty; but each 
successful Endurance test now increases in penalty by 15 until 
the test is failed or the disease is cured.

Once an Endurance test to resist progression is failed during 
stage three, the character has completed their transition into 
becoming a lycanthrope. They also immediately and painfully 
transform into their beast form, which counts as a use of their 
transformation ability.

Once  the  character  has  completed  their  transition  into 
Lycanthropy, the effects of this disease are no longer active and 
the wound becomes treatable. After this point, the characters 
lycanthropy cannot be cured by any commonly known mundane 
or magical means.

Black-Heart Blight
Black-Heart Blight is an acute blight disease affecting the victims 
strength and endurance. It may be contracted from corprus beasts 
or other blighted monsters. The disease has also spread to zombies, 
allowing it to live on despite the ending of the Blight in 3E 427.
Gestation: 3 days, -10
Stages:

Stage 1: Lose 10 Strength and 5 Endurance
Stage 2: Lose 15 Strength and 10 Endurance
Stage 3: Lose 20 Strength and 15 Endurance

Chanthrax Blight
Chanthrax is an acute blight disease affecting the victims dexterity 
and mobility. It may be contracted from corprus beasts or other 
blighted monsters. The disease has also spread to boars and zombies, 
allowing it to live on despite the ending of the Blight in 3E 427.
Gestation: 3 days, -15
Stages:

Stage 1: Lose 10 Agility and 1 Speed
Stage 2: Lose 15 Agility and 3 Speed
Stage 3: Lose 20 Agility and 5 Speed

Lycanthropic Diseases
Lycanthropic diseases are contracted from lycanthropes and 
cause the afflicted character to transform into a were-creature. 
Sanies Lupinus is the most common strain and the strain respon-
sible for werewolves. There are other strains which result in other 
forms of lycanthropes, like werebears and wereboars.

During the three-stage incubation period of the disease, infected 
characters commonly experience fatigue, muscle and bone pains, 
and vivid nightmares. Additionally, the wound that caused the 
contraction will start to fester and cannot be treated through 
normal or magical means unless the disease is cured, or the 
character completes their transition into lycanthropy.

Stage One

Stage Two

Stage Three

- The source wound

and its passive 
effects are doubled
- Gain 2 lvls of

Carriers: Werewolves, Werebears, Wereboars, and any other 
Were-creatures

Disease Progression:
The effects of stage one take hold immediately upon contraction.
Then, each dawn following contraction, the character must 
succeed an Endurance test +0 or the disease progresses to Stage 

121

Vampiric Diseases
Vampiric diseases come in many forms, Porphyric Hemophilia 
and Sanguinare Vampiris being the most common. Rarer 
strains of the vampiric disease include Chaotica Vampiris and 
Noxiphilic Sanguivoria.

No matter the origin, however, these diseases are related in one 
primary aspect in that they progress until the victim transforms 
entirely into a vampire. As they progress, they also share the same 
effects on their victims: starting with fatigue and a sensitivity 
to sunlight and progressing to a full-on sunlight aversion and 
an inability to satiate their hunger through normal means. As 
the transition into vampirism progresses, the victim is often 
plagued by vivid dreams of consuming blood.

Stage One

Stage Three

- Weakness (Fire, 3)
- Sun-Scarred (3)
- Gain 1 level of

- Weakness (Fire, 4)
- Sun-Scarred (5)
- Gain 2 levels of 
Fatigue

- Weakness (Fire, 6)
- Sun-Scarred (10)
- Eating does not 
satiate hunger

Carriers: Vampires

Disease Progression:
The effects of Stage One take hold after the character takes a 
long rest or at the next dawn; whichever comes first.
After Stage One takes effect, the character must test Endurance 
-10 each dawn. If they fail, then the disease progresses to stage 
two.

Similarly, the character must test Endurance each dawn after 
Stage Two takes effect, but this time, at a -20 penalty. On a 
failure, the disease progresses to Stage Three.

At Stage Three, the character must continue to test Endurance 
each dawn, but now at a -30 penalty. On a failure, the character 
dies painfully as their body succumbs to the illness. Then, after 
1d4 days, they arise again, fully transformed into a vampire.

At any time during Stage Three, the afflicted character can 
choose to succumb to the transformation by consuming the 
blood of any creature with a Black Soul (generally, sentient 
races) that does not have the undead or undying trait.

Once the character has completed their transformation, the 
effects of this disease are no longer active. After this point, the 
characters vampirism cannot be cured by any commonly known 
mundane or magical means. See the 

Curses
Characters whose lycanthropic or vampiric diseases are brought 
to full-term become cursed by their affliction. Sometimes those 
affected by these curses see them as a blessing rather than a curse. 
This, as with many things, is a matter of perspective considering 
that both vampirism and lycanthropy offer those afflicted with 
great boons alongside their considerable drawbacks.

Lycanthropy
Lycanthropy comes in many forms on Tamriel, but by far the 
most common are werewolves, werebears, and wereboars. When 
a characters lycanthropic disease is allowed to fully gestate, the 
character becomes a lycanthrope with the strain of the lycan-
thropy which caused the original disease contraction.

The Transition
Once a character has completed the transition into lycanthropy, 
they gain the following:
  Silver-Scarred (2)
  Immunity (Disease)
  Restless: The character is plagued by difficulty with sleep. 
They only restore half the health, magicka, and stamina 
they normally would while resting.

Additionally, they gain the following according to their lycan-
thropy strain:

Werewolf

  +5 Strength
  +5 Endurance
  +10 Agility
  +10 perception
  Natural Toughness (2)

Wereboar

  +5 Strength
  +15 Endurance
  +5 Agility
  +5 perception
  Natural Toughness (4)

Werebear

  +10 Strength
  +10 Endurance
  +5 Agility
  +5 perception
  Natural Toughness (3)

122

The Beast Form
When a lycanthrope transforms into their beast form, they drop 
all of their gear. Any worn armor at the time of transformation  
gains the Damaged (1) quality. Then, they gain the following:
  Restore up to their max SP plus an additional 2 SP over 
their max. SP in excess of their SP max is lost when the 
transformation ends.

  Increase max HP (not current HP) by 10.
  Double the lycanthropes Natural Toughness and Silver-

Lastly, they gain a new skill at rank 0:

Bestial Instinct (Str, Ag, Prc)
This skill represents the lycanthropes instinctual abilities while 
in beast form. Unlike other skills, ranks in this skill can only 
be increased through the purchase of talents and cannot be 
purchased directly. Only while they are in their beast form, 
the lycanthrope can choose to test this skill instead of any of 
the following, using the appropriate governing characteristic:

  Unarmed Combat Style
  Evade
  Survival
  Stealth
  Atheltics
  Acrobatics
  Navigate
  Observe

Scarred traits
  Dark Sight trait
  Quadruped trait
  Strong Jaws trait
  Penalties from jumping are halved.

Additionally, they gain the following according to their lycan-
thropy strain:

Werewolf

  Natural Weapons (Fangs, 1d8 Splitting)
  Natural Weapons (Claws, 1d10 Slashing)
  Latch On (1 SP):  If the werewolf successfully bites a target 
which results in a grapple, it latches on with all its strength, 
counting the bitten Hit Location as Crippled. This lasts 
until the grapple is broken.

Wereboar

  Natural Weapons (Tusks, 1d8 Slashing)
  Natural Weapons (Claws, 1d10 Slashing)
  Gore (1 SP): As part of a successfully damaging attack 
with their tusks, the wereboar can spend a Stamina Point 
to immediately deal a bonus SB damage.

Werebear

  Natural Weapons (Fangs, 1d10 Splitting or Crushing)
  Natural Weapons (Claws, 1d12 Slashing or Crushing)
  Maul (1 AP + 2 SP): The bear performs a melee attack 
as a primary action that deals 2d8 Crushing damage to a 
target creature within 1 meter. Additionally, all creatures 
within reach that are Medium or smaller must succeed on 
an Acrobatics or Athletics test or be knocked prone.

there. If they end their turn within the ice, they are crushed 
over time, taking 2d8 damage that ignores AR at the end of 
each of their turns.

The Thirst
Vampires must feed on a creature with a black soul at least once 
per day. If they go more than a day without feeding, then they 
can no longer gain the benefits of a short or long rest and lose 
the passive benefit from their bloodline until they feed again.

In order to feed on a target creature, the target must be restrained, 
helpless, enthralled, or otherwise susceptible to the feeding. The 
vampire makes a standard attack against the target with their 
Fangs, regaining HP equal to the damage dealt after mitigation. 
If a point of damage is successfully dealt to the target in this 
way, the targets Endurance Characteristic is reduced by 10 until 
after their next long rest; otherwise, if no damage is successfully 
dealt, this does not count as a proper feeding for the day.

If the target is helpless or otherwise meets the conditions for a 
Coup de Grce, the vampire can spend 2 AP to exsanguinate 
the target completely, killing them in the process and regaining 
the targets remaining HP. After doing so, the vampire loses 
any remaining AP. This sates the vampires thirst for two days.

Sanguiphage
Vampires sometimes feed on their kin to gain their powers. If 
a vampire kills another vampire by feeding on them, they gain 
access to the killed vampires bloodline passive ability for the 
next day.

Vampirism
Characters who complete the transition into Vampirism gain 
the following traits:
  Sun-Scarred (2)
  Dawn-Cursed (1)
  Dark Sight
  Weakness (Fire, 2)
  Resist Normal Weapons (2)
  Undead
  Natural Weapons (Fangs, 1d6 Splitting, Magic)
  Diseased (0, [Strain + Bloodline])

Additionally, the characters existing Natural Weapons profile 
gains the Slashing Weapon Quality.

Bloodlines
All vampires are members of a specific bloodline, the most 
common being the Aundae, the Quarra, the Berne, Cyrodilic 
bloodline, and the Volkihar. A vampires bloodline is passed 
on to the vampires they sire through the transmission of their 
vampiric strain.
Vampires gain a set of permanent characteristic increases based 
on their bloodline as defined in the table below:
