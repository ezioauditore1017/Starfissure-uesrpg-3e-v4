> [!note] Overview  
> This chapter introduces players to the core mechanics of UESRPG 3e, outlines the dice system, and explains how to interpret rolls and difficulty levels.

## The Basics of Play

In UESRPG, actions are resolved using percentile dice (d100). A player rolls two ten-sided dice—one for the tens digit and one for the ones digit. The goal is to roll **equal to or under** your target number (TN), which is determined by a relevant Attribute or Skill.

### Example of a Roll

> [!example] Skill Check Example  
> A character attempts to break down a wooden door. Their Strength (STR) is 42, so their Target Number (TN) is 42. If they roll 42 or less on a d100, they succeed.

### Criticals and Fumbles

- **Critical Success:** A roll of **01–05** (or 1/20th of your TN if lower) is a critical success.
    
- **Critical Failure:** A roll of **96–100** (or 5% above your TN) is a critical failure.
    

> [!rule] Degrees of Success (DoS)  
> The number of tens by which your roll is under your TN determines your **Degree of Success**. For example:
> 
> - Roll 37 against TN 42 → 0 DoS (bare success)
>     
> - Roll 22 against TN 42 → 2 DoS
>     
> - Roll 03 against TN 42 → 3 DoS (critical success)
>     

## Difficulty Levels

The GM assigns a Difficulty Modifier (DM) to checks based on circumstances. This modifies the TN before rolling.

|Difficulty|Modifier|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Very Easy|+30|Reading a clearly written note|
|Easy|+20|Climbing a ladder|
|Routine|+10|Conversing in your native tongue|
|Standard|+0|Average task under normal conditions|
|Challenging|-10|Picking a basic lock|
|Hard|-20|Tracking in rain|
|Very Hard|-30|Jumping across a wide gap|
|Extreme|-40|Hacking Imperial security systems|
|Nearly Impossible|-50|Deflecting an arrow mid-air|

> [!tip] GM Guidance  
> Always consider the narrative context before assigning a modifier. Tasks performed under duress or poor conditions may warrant additional penalties.

## Opposed Tests

When two characters act directly against one another, both roll against their TNs. The character with the **higher Degrees of Success** wins the contest.

> [!example] Opposed Roll Example  
> A thief (Sneak 45) attempts to hide from a guard (Perception 38). Both roll: the thief gets 27 (2 DoS), the guard rolls 19 (1 DoS). The thief wins, remaining unseen.

## Cooperative Tests

Sometimes multiple characters work together on a task. Each participant rolls; the highest Degree of Success applies, with +10 per additional helper who succeeded.

> [!example] Cooperation Example  
> Three scholars (Lore 52, 47, and 33) research a rare spell. Two succeed; one gets 1 DoS and the other 2 DoS. The team counts as 3 DoS total for the effort.

## Luck Points

Luck Points allow players to influence the outcome of rolls.

|Use|Cost|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Re-roll|1|Re-roll a failed check, keeping the new result|
|Modify|1|Add or subtract 10 from a single roll|
|Avoid Death|2|Negate a killing blow, left at 1 HP|

> [!note] Luck Point Refresh  
> Luck refreshes at the GM's discretion—usually at the end of a session or major story milestone.

## Time and Turns

Game time in UESRPG is divided into rounds, turns, and narrative time.

- **Round:** ~6 seconds of in-game time, used in combat.
    
- **Turn:** The time it takes a character to perform one action during a round.
    
- **Narrative Time:** Flexible, used outside combat to cover travel, downtime, or dialogue.
    

> [!example] Time Example  
> Combat begins as a Daedra appears. Each round represents about 6 seconds; after four rounds, only 24 seconds have passed in-world.

## Summary of Core Mechanics

- Roll percentile dice for actions.
    
- Aim to roll **equal or lower** than your TN.
    
- Apply Difficulty Modifiers for environmental factors.
    
- Determine Degrees of Success for result quality.
    
- Use Opposed and Cooperative tests where applicable.
    
- Spend Luck Points to shift fate in your favor.
    

> [!tip] Remember  
> The numbers serve the story, not the other way around. Rolls exist to create tension, resolve uncertainty, and inspire roleplay outcomes.
