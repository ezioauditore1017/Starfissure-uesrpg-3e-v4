The reference materials in this section are for players to use to 
create their own spells. See Unconventional Spells in Chapter 
6 for details.

Spell Attributes
   Many spells have attributes listed in their profiles that modify 
their rules or clarify how they function in game terms. The rules 
for spell attributes apply to all types of spells but are included 
in this section for convenience:

  Attack: Using this effect is considered an Attack for the 
purposes of determining Attacks per round. Requires a 
Primary Cast Magic Action to cast.

  Instant: This spell can be cast using a Secondary Action, 
permitting the caster to either cast the spell on their turn 
or as a Reaction outside of their turn.
      Potion: A potion can be created with this spell effect.

 
  Toxin: A toxin can be created with this spell effect.
 

      Upkeep: The caster can, as a free action, refresh the effect 
(including any required tests or rolls, not including the 
casting test, using the original target(s)) and duration of 
this spell when it ends by paying the original cost that they 
paid for the spell as long as the requirements for the spell 
(like range) are still met. If the spell has no listed duration, 
then the character cannot upkeep the spell if they have cast 
a different spell since the original cast. If a spell has the 
Attack attribute, then upkeeping the spell counts toward 
the maximum attacks per round limit.
 Overload: The caster benefits from an extra effect (as spec-
ified) if not restraining this spell.
 Reinforce: By default, spells with this attribute have no 
extra effects. When a character takes the Mage Guard and 
the Arcane Defender talents, they benefit from a bonus to 
the spell effect if not restraining the spell.
    Ranged (range): Spell can affect a target within the listed 
range.
   Melee (range): Spell counts as melee with the listed range. 
Does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      Direct: This spell has a target or targets. These kinds of 
spells cannot do damage and cannot be defended against 
by normal means.

 

 

 

 

 

Spell Forms
This page contains a list of spell forms.  A Form is the shape 
of the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fireball, 
which uses the ball form) while others are cast only on the 
caster themselves (the self  form). Most spell form have a base 
cost associated with them and a single parameter (which is 
represented by the variable Z) to determine their size. Many 
also have attributes associated with them: these are imparted 
to the final spell.

Self
Potion
Cost: 1
Affects the caster.

      AoE (range, form): This spell counts as a ranged area of 

 

 

effect of the given form/radius.
     Mindlock (X): Reduces the casters max AP by X to a 
minimum of zero. 
     [Variation]: This spell has multiple variations, each cor-
responding to one of the listed items. Each variation is its 
own spell that must be learned separately. 

Touch
Ranged (1m)
Cost: 1
Affects a single target character within 1m of the caster.

Bolt
Ranged (100m)
Cost: 2

238

Affects a single target character within 100m of the caster.

Target
Direct
Cost: 4
Affects a single target character within 50m of the caster. If this 
spell would alter the Targets mind or harm them in any way, 
this form becomes a Direct Attack.

Ball
 Ranged, AoE (1 + Zm, sphere)
Cost: 5 + Z
Affects all targets within 1 + Z meters of target point within 
100m of the caster.

Beam
        Ranged, AoE (10 + 10*Zm, beam)
Cost: 5 + Z
Affects all targets within a 1m wide line 10 + (10 x Z) meters 
in chosen direction from the caster.

Chain
Ranged (50m)
Cost: 5 + Z
Affects a single target within 50m of the caster. Then affects up 
to Z additional targets of the caster's choice, each within 10m 
of the previous target.

Cloak
Upkeep
Cost: 4
Affects all targets within 1m at the end of each of the casters 
turns. This Form ignores the Attack attribute at GM discretion.

Cone
AoE (3 + Zm, cone)
Cost: 5 + Z
Affects all targets within a 3 + Z meter cone (a cone with a 
length of 3 + Z meters, and the same width).

Pulse
 AoE (1 + Zm, sphere)
Cost: 4 + Z
Affects all targets within 1 + Z meters of the caster.

Rune
Cost: 5 + Z
Creates a magical rune that takes up 1 square meter on a surface 
within 1 meter. After a 1 round delay the rune becomes barely 
visible (-20 to any vision based tests to spot it). The caster 
chooses one or more conditions upon which the rune detonates. 
The rune persists indefinitely.

 

 
 

    Proximity: The rune detonates whenever a character comes 
within a certain distance (chosen by the caster).
    Time: The rune detonates after a set amount of time.
    Manual: The caster can detonate the rune manually from 
any distance by using the Cast Magic action.

 When the rune detonates it affects all targets within 1 + Z meters. 
This counts as an area of effect attack and can be evaded, but 
only if a character is aware of the rune.

This Form ignores the Attack attribute at GM discretion.

Storm
Upkeep, AoE (1 + (3 x Z), sphere), (loses the Overload 
attribute)
Cost: 5 + Z
Affects all targets within 1 + (3 x Z) meters of target point within 
100m. Leaves behind a persistent zone in this area for 1 round 
that causes the same effect to any characters who pass through 
it (or end their turn in it if they started there). Upkeeping the 
spell does not let the caster move the storm, it merely refreshes 
the effect and duration.

Wall
Upkeep, AoE (Z, wall)
Cost: 5 + Z
Creates a wall 1m wide and 1 + (2 x Z) meters long within 100m, 
with an orientation chosen by the caster. Affects all targets within 
the area of the wall. Leaves behind a persistent zone in this area 
for 1 round that causes the same effect to any characters who 
enter it (or end their turn in it if they started there). Upkeeping 
the spell does not let the caster move the wall, it merely refreshes 
the effect and duration.

Spell Effects
The next page contains a list of spell effects.  An Effect is the 
actual content of a spell: the fire effect causes fire damage while 
the heal effect heals it.

Most spell effects have a cost determined by a static multiplier 
times the chosen spell level (SL). Many also have attributes 
associated with them: these are imparted to the final spell.

Unless otherwise specified, spell effects do not stack with 
themselves (multiple fortify spells do not stack on top of 
one another, for example).

If the character is casting a multi-part spell, then resolve each 
part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the parts 
benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).

This spell effect can stack and each instance of this spell is

Target character within 50m of the caster gains a magical barrier 
with SL HP that envelopes them and protects against physical 
damage for 1 round. Any damage the caster takes from this 
damage type reduces the barriers HP first.

This barriers HP does not belong to the target, but rather is 
the HP of the barrier before it breaks. If any of the barriers HP 
remains at the end of the duration, then the spell does not cost 
MP to upkeep and the barriers HP refreshes entirely. Otherwise, 
if all the HP of the barrier is lost at the end of the duration, then 
the spell cannot be refreshed via upkeep and must be cast again.

Conjure [Armor]

Conjure [Weapon]

Summons one of the following sets of Bound Daedric armour (Both Arms; 
Both Legs, Body; or Head;) that follows the profile determined by its SL. 
The armour slots this spell summons must be determined when the spell is 
learned.

This piece of armor magically replaces whatever armor a willing target is 
currently wearing on that location for one minute. The armor piece counts as 
one weight class lighter for the purpose of armor penalties, and does not need 
to be among the target's trained armor classes in its combat style. The armour 
has the Bound and Summoned traits.
SL 2: Inferior Partial Daedric
SL 3: Inferior Full Daedric
SL 4: Partial Daedric
SL 5: Full Daedric
SL 6: Superior Partial Daedric
SL 7: Superior Full Daedric

Notes:

  This effect cannot be used at Spell level 1
  Adding more than 1 instance of this effect causes the cost of all instances 
of this effect after the first to be 2 x SL, but only if used in the self form.

Summons a Bound Daedric weapon or shield of casters choice that follows 
the profile determined by its [Spell Level]. The weapon type must be deter-
mined when the spell is learned.
SL 2: Primitive Quality
SL 4: Standard
SL 6: Proven Quality

This weapon appears in a willing targets hand(s) for the duration of the 
spell or until the weapon leaves the target's hands. The target gains a [Spell 
Strength] weapon (with ammo) with the Bound and Summoned traits of the 
chosen type for 1 minute. Weapons with the reload quality are not loaded 
when they are summoned; however, the value of the first reload action is 
reduced by 1. If the weapon is not in any of the target's Combat Styles, they 
count it as being Trained (+0).

Notes:

  This effect can only be used at Spell Levels 2, 4, and 6.

Summon Construct

Summon Daedra

Summons a construct with the Summoned trait, which appears within five 
meters of the caster. Immediately after being summoned, the Construct 
must make a Willpower test against the DoS of the Conjuration test. If the 
Conjurer wins the test, the Construct gains the Bound trait and persists for 
1 round, If the Construct wins the Opposed test, it is not Bound and can 
act as it pleases, typically murdering its summoner. The unbound Construct 
can test Willpower at the end of each round to maintain itself in Mundus. 
Keeping the Construct in line imposes [Spell Str] Mindlock on the caster. 
If the spell ends because the caster chooses not to upkeep this spell and the 
summoned creature has the Bound trait, the creature loses the Summoned 
trait and returns to their plane of origin.

Roll initiative for the Construct when its summoned, as it acts on its own 
turn. If this spell is restrained, the summoned creatures Maximum AP 
is reduced by 1 while they have the Bound trait.

For each time the spell is bought, pick one spell profile from the table below 
and mark it on your sheet.

Note: Spell Strength depends on the construct summoned, which can be 
found in its profile on the page below.

Summons a Daedra with the Summoned trait, which appears within five 
meters of the caster. Immediately after being summoned, the Daedra must 
make a Willpower test against the DoS of the Conjuration test. If the

round, If the Daedra wins the Opposed test, it is not Bound and can act as 
it pleases, typically murdering its summoner. The unbound Daedra can test 
Willpower at the end of each round to maintain itself in Mundus. Keeping 
the Daedra in line imposes [Spell Str] Mindlock on the caster. If the spell

using the profile it had in life. The target must immediately test an 
Opposed Willpower with the caster. If the caster wins the test, the 
target also has the Bound trait. If the target wins the test, they are 
reanimated but are not Bound to the caster.

The target is reanimated with full HP, Stamina Points, Action Points, 
Magicka, and any uses of limited use abilities.

Reanimate

The spell imbues the body with the spirit of a lesser daedra, and has 
no shred of the characters consciousness, soul, or any knowledge 
of their past life except for skills, talents, traits, and spells. They do 
not retain powers gained from their race.

Upkeep, Direct, Mindlock(1)

5 x SL

After the reanimated creature dies again or if the spell ends (due to 
unpaid upkeep or any other reason), the reanimated creature turns 
to a pile of ash and cannot be reanimated.

Note: The SL determines the size of the creature that can be reanimated, 
starting with "Puny" and stepping up one size for each SL beyond the first 
(Tiny, Small, Standard, Large, Huge, Massive). 

The caster summons a Ghost (SL 2) or an Ancient Ghost (SL 3) into 
Mundus for one round. The caster and the Ghost must immediately 
roll an Opposed Willpower test; if the caster succeeds, the Ghost 
has the Bound trait for the duration.

Upkeep, Mindlock(1)

Summon Wraith

The caster summons a Wraith (SL 4) or a Gloom Wraith (SL 5) into 
Mundus for one round. The caster and the Wraith must immediately 
roll an Opposed Willpower test; if the caster succeeds, the Wraith 
has the Bound trait for the duration.

The UESRPG Discord Community
It is highly recommended that GMs and players alike join the UESRPG Discord Community. We often refer to the discord as 
a core supplement to this game. There are many active veterans of this system available at all times of day in the chat server's 
various chat channels who are happy to answer any questions that arise from reading or play. An invite to the server can be found 
at  discord.gg/HWZVw2qTE5. 

The UESRPG Subreddit
While the UESRPG Subreddit isn't nearly as active as the Discord Community, it can serve as a suitable alternative to those who 
prefer not to use discord. If the above Discord link is broken, an updated link can usually be found on the subreddit as well. The 
subreddit can be visited at www.reddit.com/r/UESRPG/.

Homebrew Content
A valued community member and contributor to this book, TutorialTuna, has a veritable treasure trove of homebrew content that can be 
found in the Google Drive found by following this link: drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OEyIGpNO5dL7USX7ASp4-Ls195QDge0l.

Additional homebrew content can be found pinned and being discussed in the #homebrew-channel in the discord community.

Lore and Inspiration
Outside of resources specific to this system, there are a number of communities who do a lot of work cataloging Elder Scrolls 
lore and materials.

The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP), a respected lore wiki community dedicated to scribing lore and other in-game 
information, can be found at UESP.net.

The Imperial Library is a website dedicated to the archival of in-game and out-of-game lore books alike. It also archives non-canon 
lore posts by official and respected unofficial sources alike, great for inspiration when canon lore doesn't quite do the trick. It can 
be found at imperial-library.info.

The Elder Scrolls Fandom Wiki, while often admonished for its somewhat imprecise approach to verifying sources and edits to 
its articles, is a rather useful resource similar to UESP. In the context of TTRPGs, it can prove rather useful for inspiring creativity 
for many of the reasons it does not serve as a reliable source for canon lore. It can be found at elderscrolls.fandom.com.
