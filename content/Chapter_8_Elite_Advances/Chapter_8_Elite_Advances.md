# Chapter 8: Elite Advances

So many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. Its a very sad state of affairs, 
when the game is really open to all, you dont need an invitation. And it is a game, the game of bargaining, to be 
played seriously and, I hasten to add, politely.

The Buying Game

 
Within this chapter lies the path to extraordinary power and 

legendary prowess, where characters transcend beyond 
their already formidable abilities. These Elite Advances are not 
mere steps in a characters journey, but leaps into realms of 
almost mythic capabilities.

Its important to note that Elite Advances are not intended for 
character creation except for in hight XP starts. They repre-
sent a level of power and knowledge that is typically beyond 
the reach of novice or even intermediate adventurers. These 
advanced paths are optional and are best introduced with great 
consideration. Game Masters should consider the inclusion of 
Elite Advances on a per-character basis, ensuring that it aligns 
well with the characters development, the narrative, and the 
overall balance of your campaign.

Moreover, we strongly encourage Game Masters to introduce 
Elite Advances through the games narrative. These extraordinary 
powers should feel like an integral part of the world their players 
are exploring. GMs should consider weaving these opportunities 
into their story, allowing characters to discover and pursue them 
through their in-game actions and choices. This approach not 
only enhances the immersion but also maintains the organic 
flow of the story.

Elite Advances should feel like hard-earned rewards or significant 
milestones in a characters journey. Whether its uncovering 
ancient secrets, undergoing rigorous training, or being chosen 
by the gods, the path to these powers should be as memorable 
as the abilities themselves.

As you venture into this chapter, consider the impact and pos-
sibilities these Elite Advances bring. They are tools to elevate a 
campaign and provide players with experiences that are truly 
legendary.

White-Gold Artificer

The character is privy to the ancient lores and starlight-forges 
of the Ayleidoon.
250 XP if an Ayleid, burn 10 Luck if not an Ayleid.
The character is able to learn new Ayleid crafting talents, and 
when they use a Welkynd Stone to replenish Magicka, can 
test Willpower to only drain the Stone instead of destroy it. 
When using a Welkynd or Varla Stone, the character can test 
Enchanting at +0. If successful, the Welkynd or Varla Stone is 
not consumed by the character, only drained of its power.

Talents

Patterns of the Ayleids
Adept (Intelligence)
Requires Adept Profession[Smithing], Adept Lore, White-
Gold Artificer
The character has learned the secrets of forging the weapons 
and armour used by the ancient Ayleids, which are blessed by 
starlight. The character can create Welkynd Moonstone and 
Varla Malachite Armour and Weapons.

Ancient Secrets
Master (Intelligence)
Requires Patterns of the Ayleids
The character has unlocked the secrets of starlight and, with 
the right materials and timing, can restore power to and create 
Welkynd and Varla stones. The character learns the Siphon 
Starlight and Create Ayleid Stone rituals.

Ayleid Equipment

Welkynd Equipment
When forging Moonstone armour or weapons, a character who 
has the Patterns of the Ayleids talent can imbue the magic-
ka-containing powers of Welkynd Stone into the piece by 
catalyzing an intact Welkynd Stone or by using 10 Pinches of 
Welkynd Stone Dust (see Welkynd Stones entry). The character 
crafts the piece as normal, but limits the Profession[Smithing] 
test by the characters choice of Lore or Mysticism. If the test 
would normally pass for Blacksmithing but fails due to the 
limiting skill, the armour is created as Moonstone, and is not 
successfully imbued with the power of the Ayleids.

If successful, the weapon or armour piece is imbued with the 
power of Welkynd Stones. It is treated exactly as Moonstone, 
Though it gains one of the following Armor or Weapon Qualities 
as appropriate.

Welkynd Armor Quality
If you are targeted by a spell, roll a d10. On a roll of 3 or 
lower, the spell effect does not resolve and the Magicka spent 
on the spell is conducted through the powdered and lacquered 
Welkynd dust woven into the armour and added to the char-
acters Magicka Points.

Welkynd Weapon Quality
The weapon also gains the Focus quality, and gains one charge 
of Starlight. The character can spend a charge of Starlight to 
gain a +20 bonus to the casting test of a spell while weilding 
this weapon. The weapon, if left under starlight for at least 4 
hours, regains one spent charge. It can only hold up to three 
charges at a time. Additionally, Welkynd weapons can cast up 

191

to 10m of bright light as a free action.

the purpose of being magically dispelled.

Varla Equipment
When forging Malachite armour, a character can imbue the 
magicka-containing powers of a Varla Stone into the piece 
by catalyzing an intact Varla Stone, or by using 10 Pinches of 
Varla Stone Dust (see Varla Stones entry). The character crafts 
the piece as normal, but limits the Blacksmithing test by their 
Lore and Mysticism skills. If failed, if the test would normally 
pass for Blacksmithing, the armour is created as Malachite and 
is not successfully imbued with the power of the Ayleids.

If successful, the weapon or armour piece is imbued with the 
power of Varla Stones. It is treated exactly as Malachite, though 
it gains one of the following properties

Varla Armor Quality
If you are targeted by a spell, roll a d10. On a roll of 5 or 
lower, the spell effect does not resolve and the Magicka spent 
on the spell is conducted through the powdered and lacquered 
Welkynd dust woven into the armour and added to the char-
acters Magicka Points.

Varla Weapon Quality
The weapon also gains the Focus quality, and gains two charges 
of Starlight. The character can spend a charge of Starlight to 
gain a +30 bonus to the casting test of a spell while weilding 
this weapon. The weapon, if left under starlight for at least 4 
hours, regains one spent charge. It can only hold up to five 
charges at a time. Additionally, Welkynd weapons can cast up 
to 15m of bright light as a free action.

Welkynd Lanterns
A Welkynd lantern runs not on oil or candle, but by magicka 
using a harvested and refined Welkynd crystal. Easily used and 
operated and requiring only a modest amount of magicka, a 
Welkynd lantern can cast great light in a staggeringly large radius, 
or be used to quietly and dimly light an area.

A Welkynd lantern is a light source that weighs 1 ENC. Because 
it is magical, it stays lit even while underwater, in Oblivion, or 
anywhere else that might prevent conventional fires from being 
lit, and also does not give off an odor, sound, or smoke.

As an action, a character can light a Welkynd lantern by touching 
it. Doing so, they can expend up to 10 Magicka Points. Each 
point of magicka spent allows it to cast bright light for up to 
10m  (magicka spent) for 4 hours. The character can touch 
the lantern to extinguish it, but relighting it will cost the full 
MP cost again if they chose to do so.

The Welkynd Lanterns light effect is treated as Spell Level 3 for 

Welkynd Stones
Welkynd Stones are aquamarine stones commonly found in 
ayleid cities, with meteoric iron bases. A character can harness 
the power of a Welkynd Stone with a Secondary Cast Magic 
Action, after which the character drains the stone of its power 
and is restored to full Magicka points. The stone then crumbles 
away into a Pinch of Welkynd Stone Dust.

Dark Welkynd Stones
Small crystals of black-light, an inversion of their aqueous-blue 
cousins, Dark Welkynd Stones are imbued with sorcerous power 
and are left suspended by magic to act as simple sentinels.

A character with an inert Dark Welkynd Stone can power it 
with a successful -20 Mysticism test as a Cast Magic Secondary 
Action. While activated, the Dark Welkynd Stone will float 
about a meter off the ground and can be moved by pushing 
or carrying it around. The character can then nominate either 
targets to be attacked or targets to be ignored. The character 
can then cast a Destruction spell up to spell level 2 into the 
Dark Welkynd Stone causing the crystal to imbued with this 
spell. A Dark Welkynd Stone can only be imbued with 1 spell 
at any given time.

The Dark Welkynd Stone will, once per round, cast this spell 
as a Bolt at the nearest eligible target (always succeeds with 
1 DoS) until the character passes a +20 Mysticism test as 
a Cast Magic Secondary Action to make it stop, or it runs 
out of Magicka. The character must manually charge it with 
their own Magicka as an Action, transferring as much of their 
own available Magicka into it as they wish as a +0 Mysticism 
test. The Dark Welkynd Stone holds up to 100 Magicka. 

Varla Stones
Varla Stones are white, luminescent stones created from 
enchanted shards of meteoric glass. They are quite rare, even 
for ayleid ruins, as they have been mostly picked clean due to 
their powerful ability to recharge magic items.

A character can harness the power of a Varla Stone by using 
a Secondary Cast Magic Action and choosing an Enchanted 
Item, after which the character drains the stone of its power 
and restores up to 1000 of the chosen items Soul Energy. The 
stone then crumbles away into a Pinch of Varla Stone Dust.

Imbuing Equipment
When forging equipment with Moonstone or Malachite, a 
character possessing the Patterns of the Ayleids talent can imbue 
it with the magicka-containing powers of Ayleid Stones. For 
Moonstone equipment, use Welkynd Stones, and for Malachite,

the ritual. Once the test is successful, the character places the 
stone at the center of this ritually prepared area. The stone must 
then be left undisturbed overnight. By morning, if the ritual is 
uninterrupted, the stone will have regained its charge and will 
function as intended.

use Varla Stones. This is achieved by catalyzing an intact stone 
or using 10 Pinches of the respective Stones Dust.

The crafting process follows the normal procedure, but the 
Profession[Smithing] test is limited by the characters Lore or 
Mysticism skills. Should the test fail due to these limiting skills 
while it would normally pass for Blacksmithing, the item is cre-
ated as standard Moonstone or Malachite without the Ayleidic 
powers. On a success, the item gains one of the appropriate 
weapon or armor qualities for the type (Varla or Welkynd).

Ayleid Rituals
The creation of Welkynd and Varla stones was a secret closely 
guarded by the Ayleid people. With time and very meticulous 
research, few individuals outside the Ayleids have uncovered 
the secret rituals known to fabricate them.

Create Welkynd Stone
To create a Welkynd stone, the character must accrue approxi-
mately 150 drakes worth of materials and any valuable gemstone 
with exception of a Diamond. Then the character may make a 
-10 Profession[Smithing] test followed by a -10 Enchanting test 
to create the stone. If the gemstone used to make the Welkynd 
stone is one of those listed below, activating it grants one of the 
following effects until the characters next long rest in addition 
to the standard effect. These effects do not stack with themselves.

  Amethyst: Character gains Resistance(Magic, 2)
  Emerald: Character increases their SP max by 1.
 
  Ruby: Character increases their max HP by 3.
  Saphhire: Character gains Power Well(10).

 Garnet: Character increases their Wound Threshold by 1.

If any of these gemstones happen to be flawless, both of the 
tests made to create the stone become -30, and the effects of 
each stone are doubled.

Create Varla Stone
To create a Varla stone, the character must accrue approximately 
250 drakes worth of materials and a diamond gemstone. Then the 
character must make a +0 Profession[Smithing] test followed by 
a +0 Enchanting test to create the stone. Once created, this stone 
functions the same as any other Varla stone. If the Diamond 
is flawless, then the tests become -20 and the resulting Varla 
stone can be used to fully recharge an enchanted item 3 times 
before it crumbles into dust.

Siphon Starlight
This ritual allows a character to draw energy from the stars to 
recharge Welkynd and Varla stones, either newly crafted or those 
that have lost their charge. To perform this ritual, the character 
must first prepare a designated area outdoors under the night 
sky using materials costing approximately 100 drakes. Following 
this, they undertake a Lore test with a -20 penalty to initiate 

193

lichdom

soul destroyed.

The second stage simply requires that the character remain bound 
to the Phylactery for one week. The third and final stage is a ritual, 
completed on the last day of the second stage. Completing this 
ritual requires a Necromancy skill test with a -30 penalty, and 
several hours. The ritual culminates at the precise moment that 
the transfer of the characters soul to and from the Phylactery 
completes: the character is simultaneously killed and his soul is 
re-bound to his body. He is now a Lich, and is no longer bound 
to the Phylactery in any way: apply the appropriate effects.

If the character fails the test, failed the test for the rites in the 
first stage, or the ritual is interrupted somehow, then the Lich 
is killed instantly and their soul destroyed.

If a Lich does not preserve its body with the Rite of Mortal 
Transcendence, when it reaches its natural age of death, its body 
will die, though its spirit will continue to inhabit it, and it will 
begin to rot away over about a month, and have its Personality 
reduced to 5, and gain the Skeletal trait.

Lich Traits
  Dark Sight
  Immune to Frost.
  Resistance (Shock, Normal Weapons, 3).
  Power Well (25)
  Skeletal Claws: 1d8 Slashing, Reaach 1m
  Undead: The Lich does not eat, breath, or require organs 
to function. The Lich is immune to disease, poison, passive 
wound effects, aging, Fatigue, Dazed, Deafened, and Organ 
Damage. Liches cannot take actions that would cause them 
fatigue.

Special Abilities

Dark Ceremony
Cost: 1 SP + [15 x corpse] Magicka
As a Primary Cast Magic Action, the Lich can immediately raise 
a number of nearby corpses up to their WB for 1 minute, using 
the profile of Zombies. They will attack any living beings nearby, 
and are not bound to the will of the Lich, but they will not be 
hostile to them either. This is not spell :)

|Liches are necromancers who have embraced undeath: they have 
used an object known as a Phylactery to transfer their soul out of 
their body so that it might be bound to them again at the moment 
of their death, thus rendering themselves immortal, undead beings. 
Liches are resistant to several elements, and able to harness more 
magicka for spells (a side effect of the transformation process).

The character has completed the Rite of Unlife Ritual successfully 
and has become a Lich.

Requires 500 XP The Rite of Unlife having been successfully 
completed.

The Rite of Unlife
This ritual can be purchased outside of having the Lichdom Elite 
Advance, being a prerequisite of it.

Lichdom is achieved through the Rite of Unlife, an advanced 
ritual known only to a select few. Becoming a Lich is not a simple 
task, and simply learning the details of the Rite of Unlife is a 
difficult task. If a character manages to discover the secret (such 
as by finding a copy of the forbidden Tome of Unlife) then they 
can perform it themselves using the following steps:

Becoming a Lich essentially requires enchanting ones corpse with 
ones own soul. This is a three step process, and takes roughly 
two weeks. First, a number of minor rituals are performed 
which result in the characters soul being bound to a temporary 
storage vessel, known as a Phylactery. Second, the character 
must remain near the Phylactery for several days as the transfer 
of his soul completes.

Finally, a third ritual is performed, ending at the exact moment 
the transfer completes. During this phase, the character dies, and 
his soul is re-bound to his corpse, granting him full Lichdom.

In game terms, the first stage requires a week long set of rituals to 
prepare the Phylactery, and the characters body, for the transition 
to undeath. Successfully completing these rites requires passing 
a single -20 Necromancy skill test. The GM should make this 
test for the character in secret, and note the results. The rites 
themselves will vary depending on the source from which the 
character learns of them, but they invariably require a number of 
gruesome components (the details of which are left to the GM).

The character must also choose an object to be their Phylactery. 
After the Phylactery is chosen and the preparatory rites are 
complete, the character is then bound to the Phylactery. If this 
object passes further than 3 meters away from them while they 
are bound to it, then the character is killed instantly and their

PAin Sorcerer

The Ayleids were a very cruel race, and their love of pain and torture, 
as well as their worship of Daedra led them to create a very sick 
and twisted magic based on manipulating the flesh of their enemies, 
and even sometimes themselves.

Disclaimer: The rules for this elite advance play with 
some heavy themes of torture and pain in general.

The character is studied in the arts of dark flesh-magic, and is 
fuelled by the pain and torment of others.

1000 XP if an Ayleid or is being trained, otherwise 1500XP.

The character has access to the Flesh Magic skill, and generates a 
Pain Point (PP) any time a living creature or character within 
their Perception in metres is slain, Wounded, Burning, Bleeding, 
or fails a Fear or Horror test, or otherwise suffers excruciating 
pain and torture.
An event that causes multiple of these effects to a single target 
only grants a single Pain Point. For a target to considered eligible, 
they must be living and sentient. The Flesh Shaper can store a 
number of Pain Points equal to half their Willpower score. All 
Pain Points are lost after a Long Rest.

New Skill: Flesh Magic (Int, Wp)
Wielded by ancient Ayleid sorcerers, Flesh Magic is used to twist, 
gnarl, warp, and change the living form. Fueled by agonies and 
foul murder, Flesh Magic is potent, cruel, and terrible. The GM 
may ask you to test Flesh Magic when:

  Casting a Flesh Magic Spell.
  Identifying the effects of a Flesh Magic Spell.
  Performing Flesh Magic Rituals.

Ayleid Flesh Magic
Unlike conventional magic, Flesh Magic is fuelled by Pain Points 
(PP), which are gained from the Pain Sorcerer Elite Advance. 
The caster should declare their target or targets and test to 
successfully cast the spell. If failed, the caster loses a number 
of Pain Points equal to the number of targets selected and the 
base cost of the spell, and gains +1 Corruption Score.

If successful, the caster then chooses how many Pain Points 
to invest in the spell. Pain Points purchase one additional 
spell d10. Additionally, the caster can pay one Pain Point per 
additional target beyond the first. The caster then rolls all 
d10s and applies the effects based on whether or not the 
total exceeds the target(s)s Endurance score. After the effects 
of a Flesh Magic spell wear off, the target immediately loses 

a Stamina Point. Flesh Magic spells have a range of the users 
Perception in meters.

Example: A pain sorcerer with a +30 in Flesh Magic casts Harden 
Flesh on himself, and commits 4 Pain Points to it. He successfully 
casts, and now must roll 4 d10, one for every PP spent. The Pain 
Sorcerer has an Endurance score of 31, and therefore on his 4d10 
roll must meet or beat 31. He rolls his 4d10 pool and the total 
comes out to 28, just shy! Instead of gaining Natural Toughness 3 
for 1 minute, he instead gains Natural Toughness 1 for 1 minute.

Corruption
Each time a characters Corruption Score exceeds their Endurance 
Bonus, they must roll a d20 on the table in Corruption Effects 
on page 198 and reset their Corruption Score back to 0.

Corruption Effects represent malignancies, addiction to pain, 
and pathos that develop in the character absent the indulgences 
of agony. Whenever the character has less total Pain Points 
stored than they have total number of Corruptions Effects, 
they suffer their Corruption Effects. Corruption Effects are 
permanent. This means that a character immediately suffers 
from their Corruption Effects after a Long Rest.

Pain Sorcery Spells
All Pain Sorcery Spells count as Attacks.

Harden Flesh
A classic spell cast by Pain Sorcerer to toughen themselves or their 
allies, this spell gnarls and scales the flesh of their target to better 
withstand the blade and the axe.
1 PP per d10
If the result meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, they 
gain the Natural Toughness (EB) trait for 1 minute. If it falls 
short of the targets Endurance score, they gain the Natural 
Toughness (1) trait for 1 minute instead.

Ayleid Bondage
Used by Ayleid slave-wardens to punish or bind prisoners or captives, 
this spell fuses the targets hands together at the forearm, making 
their hands and arms unusable.
2 PP per d10
If the result meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, both 
(or all) of the targets arms are treated as Crippled for a number 
of minutes equal to the casters WB.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, one of the 
targets arms (randomly determined) is treated as Crippled for 
1 round instead, as it swells and bloats, but does not gravitate 
towards or fuse with the targets other arm.

Mutate

195

The Ayleid Pain Sorcerers changed their own forms, and the forms 
of their slaves to better suit their roles and tasks.
2 PP per d10
If Mutate meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, the 
target gains the traits from one of the below Mutations of the 
casters choice for one minute:
  Amphibious*
  Natural Weapons(Beak, d6 Splitting, 1m), Strong Jaws
  Climber (Speed)
  Crawler*
  Dark Sight*
  Flyer (Speed  2)
  From Beyond
  Natural Weapons (Talons [hands or feet], d6 Slashing, 1m)
  Quadruped
  Savage
  Swimmer*
  Thick Skull
  Unrelenting Talent
  Vicious (SB + 1)
  Undying
  Catfall (Talent)*

* If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, only an
effect marked with an asterisk can be selected.

Flesh Blade
A common spell used by Ayleid Pain Sorcerers and their cohorts,
it causes the targets chosen arm to morph into a fleshy blade of 
magically infused bone and sinew.
1 PP per d10
If Flesh Blade meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
one of the targets arms transforms into a bony blade as their 
forearm bones extend and burst from their wrist, leaving their 
hand a flopping shredded mass of flesh. The arm cannot be used 
for any normal purposes, but counts as a Broadsword (d8)+1 
with the Magical trait, and gains Slashing (Casters WB) for one 
minute, which uses the characters Unarmed or Broadsword 
skill for attacks and defence.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the targets 
arm instead bloats and calcifies. This arm counts as Crippled 
and gains the Crushing(SB) and Magical Qualities for one 
round, after which the arms swelling returns to normal and the 
calcification sloughs off. The remains count as a Ubiquitous 
Alteration Alchemy ingredient.

Fleshmend
Used frequently to heal grievous wounds, Fleshmend is popular 
among any Pain Sorcerer expecting trouble.
2 PP per d10
If Fleshmend meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, all 
of the targets Wounds are immediately considered treated, and 

the character regains (EB) HP.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead heals for only EB HP. This spell can bring a character to 
full HP while they have active wounds without maiming them.

Trollblood
Harnessing the power of hypermetabolism and taking inspiration 
from the trolls that plague Cyrodiils wilderness, the Trollblood spell 
is popular for obvious reasons.
2 PP per d10
If Trollblood meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
the character gains the Regeneration ([Casters WB]) trait for 
one minute.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead gains the Regeneration (1) trait for one minute.

Painsurge
The Pain Sorcerer harnesses the raw power of agony, and lights their 
targets nerves alight.
2 PP per d10
If Painsurge meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, the 
target is wracked with crippling pain, and suffers a -30 on all 
tests for 1 minute.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead suffers a -10 on all tests for one round. This spell does 
not cause the target to gain Fatigue.

Hemorrhage
Ayleid Pain Sorcerers could use their magics to rupture the organs 
and blood vessels of their foes.
2 PP per d10
If Hemorrhage meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
the target immediately gains the Bleeding (2) condition, and 
suffers the Organ Damage condition, which must be treated 
exactly as if it were a wound.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead gains the Bleeding (1) condition. This spell does not 
cause the target to gain Fatigue.

Siphon Life
The Pain Sorcerer strips the flesh and blood off their target to mend 
their own wounds.
3 PP per d10
If Siphon Life meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
the target immediately takes 2d10 Magic damage, and the 
caster is healed for the amount of damage dealt. This ignores 
Natural Toughness.

196

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead takes 1d10 Magic damage, and the caster heals for half 
the amount of damage dealt. If a target dies from this spells 
damage, they explode into a fine mist of bone and blood, and 
cause a Horror -10 test for all characters in the immediate 
vicinity of the unfortunate victim. This spell does not cause 
the target to gain Fatigue.

Disguise Flesh
The Pain Sorcerer can disguise and shape the flesh of their target 
to appear as another.
1 PP per d10
If Disguise Flesh meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
the target is successfully disguised and can take the form of a 
specific character or creature the caster personally has seen and 
memorized the appearance of for one hour.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, the target 
instead can be disguised as a member of a different race or 
species, but no one in particular for one hour.

Blood Frenzy
The Pain Sorcerer drives their target into a furious blood rage.
1 PP per d10
If Blood Frenzy meets or exceeds the targets Endurance score, 
the target gains the Frenzy condition and the caster can choose 
if they maintain their composure or attack the nearest target 
(friend or foe) for 1 minute.

If the spell falls short of the targets Endurance score, they gain 
the Frenzy condition for 1 minute.

197

Corruption Effects
Each time a characters Corruption score exceeds their Endurance Bonus, they must roll a d20 on the Corruption table below, 
and reset their Corruption back to 0. Corruption represents malignancies, addiction to pain, and pathos that develop in the 
character absent the indulgences of agony. Whenever the character has less total Pain Points stored than they have total number 
of Corruptions, they suffer the effects of their Corruptions.

ration from more vampiric magic, the caster can now expend 
HP in place of PP at 1:1 ratio.

Red Osmosis

acter can now unnaturally fortify their bodies.
Expert (Willpower)
Using their flesh magic to boost their own physical prowess the

from those approaching deaths door.
Apprentice (Willpower, Intelligence)
Harnessing the power of death itself, the caster has unlocked 
secrets that gain him more power from the slain. When the Pain 
Sorcerer gains a Pain Point from a character or creature being 
slain or Wounded, they instead gain 2 Paint Points.

Pain Rituals
Rituals involving torture, pain, suffering, and harnessing moon-
light. Most revolve in creating a ritually prepared area, and 
boosting the effectiveness of any Flesh Magic casted within 
that area.

Rite of Desecration
This ritual requires a medium sized to large sized room to be 
prepared with various amounts of different rituals and incanta-
tions cast around the room. Preparing this room generally costs 
1000 Drakes, takes 1 day, and always requires the Pain Sorcerer 
to gain a random Corruption Effect from the Corruption Effects 
table. Depending on the size of the room, It may take a shorter 
or longer amount of time or Drakes (Up to GM discretion) as 
well as a -10 Flesh Magic skill test. On failure, repeating this 
test only requires that the character take the same amount of 
time to re-prepare the room.  Within this sanctum, The Pain 
Sorcerer has an uncapped amount of Pain Points that are not lost 
during a Long Rest, but only as long as they reside within the 
sanctum. If they leave the ritually prepared room, then any Pain 
Points gained there are kept or if they exceed their maximum, 
it is reduced to their maximum amount of Pain Points.

This Ritual is normally used by Pain Sorcerers to cast the far 
more powerful Pain Rituals, otherwise, they wouldnt be able 
to due to high Pain Point cost.

Rite of Transformation
This ritual is one of the more basic, but most powerful ritual that
a pain sorcerer may undertake. First the character must choose a
certain Flesh Magic spell to cast, then cast the ritual. To cast this
ritual it costs 100x the Pain Cost of the chosen Flesh Magic spell
as well as a -30 Flesh Magic skill test. After successfully casting

199

the chosen spell, the effects of it will become permenant upon
the target of the spell. This spell works on most Flesh Magic
spells except:
Fleshmend
 
 
Siphon Life
  Hemorrhage
  Trollblood

Rite of Superior Sorcery
This ritual makes any pain magic spell become more effective 
and has the potential to negate any negative effects the spell 
may inflict upon the user. For 50x the Pain Cost of a Flesh 
Magic spell, the spell does not have to exceed to the targets 
Endurance score to get the full effect of the spell, and the spell 
lasts for twice as long as it normally would. To cast this spell 
the character must make a -20 Flesh Magic skill test.
SWord-SinGer

The character is a Sword-Singer: they have devoted themselves to
Shehai Shen She Ru.

1000 XP if a Redguard or is being trained, otherwise 1500 XP.

The character gains the ability to train the Shehai Shen She Ru 
skill, learn and use Techniques of Aberrant Swordsmanship, 
and learn Shehai talents.

Shehai Shen She Ru
The Shehai Shen She Ru, or Way of the Spirit Sword, is the 
culmination of the art of sword-singing, practiced by ancient 
Redguards in Yokuda known as Sword-Singers. The greatest 
of the Sword-Singers were known as Ansei, or Saints of the 
Sword. There are several dimensions to the Shehai Shen She 
Ru, each a step on the path to the title of Ansei.

First is a simple devotion to swordsmanship. This is how every 
sword singer begins his journey: through intense study, and 
eventual mastery, of the art of the blade. In game terms, this 
means that characters can utilize the Shehai Shen She Ru 
skill (with either Strength or Agility) as if it were the Combat 
Style[Field] skill whenever wielding any type of sword (larger or 
smaller weapons, such as daggers and greatswords, also count).

Second is the use of special magic techniques of the blade 
known as Aberrant Swordsmanship. These techniques are feats 
of swordsmanship that go far beyond the capabilities of a normal 
man. The Sword-Singer accomplishes this by using a sword in a 
way that a sword simply cannot be used, an art that obviously 
takes extensive practice. The sword singer may perform these 
techniques with any sword, and they all require the use of the 
Shehai Shen She Ru skill.

Third, the culmination of the Way of the Spirit Sword, is the 
Shehai, the spirit sword itself. The Shehai is a literal spirit sword: 
a part of the soul of the Sword-Singer made manifest. A character 
who combines the Shehai with the many techniques of Aberrant 
Swordsmanhip has become a true Ansei. Manifesting the Shehai 
also Requires: the use of the Shehai Shen She Ru skill.

The following sections will deal with the latter two aspects of the 
Shehai Shen She Ru: Aberrant Swordsmanship, and manifesting 
the Shehai.

Skill: Shehai Shen She Ru (Str, Ag, Wp)
The core of the Shehai Shen She Ru is a simple devotion to 
swordsmanship. This is how every Sword-Singer begins their 
journey: through intense study, and eventual mastery, of the 
art of the blade.

Characters can utilize the Shehai Shen She Ru skill (with either 
Strength or Agility) as if it were the Combat Style [Field] skill 
whenever wielding any type of sword (larger or smaller weapons, 
such as daggers and greatswords, also count).

We are the ansu, the greatest warriors that live in men. Our 
swords sent the Left-Handers into the oceans, whose empire 
was four times the size of the white king. When we fight, our 
swords can kill the laws of nature itself. Yokuda is as you 
see it because our hira-dirg swords can cut the atomos, the 
uncuttable, and we did.  

      -The Hira-Dirge Ansei to Cyrus the Restless

Abberant Swordsmanship
The abilities that a student of Aberrant Swordsmanship can learn 
are known simply as Techniques. Some techniques are passive 
abilities, while others are active. Using a technique requires: 
a sword of some kind (either a physical one or a Shehai) and, 
for active techniques, the use of the Shehai Shen She Ru skill. 

Techniques count as magic, though they are not spells, and 
should thus be placed in the appropriate section of your char-
acter sheet. Characters may learn techniques with XP. Once a 
character has learned a technique, he may use it whenever he 
wants. Techniques each require a certain level of proficiency in 
the Shehai Shen She Ru skill before they may be learned or used.
There are two types of techniques: active techniques and passive 
techniques. Active techniques are specific abilities that call for 
a skill test when used. Passive techniques simply apply some 
kind of bonus or effect to the character once they have been 
learned, though some of them must be activated as Free Actions 
at the beginning of a turn or round in order to provide their 

200

 
 
effect. A character must be wielding some kind of sword in 
order to benefit.

During structured time, active techniques may be utilized with a 
Reaction or a Cast Magic Primary or Secondary Action, depend-
ing on the technique in question unless otherwise specified. Any 
attacks they do win Advantage as normal, and they do not allow 
for attacks of opportunity. Using an active technique requires 
that the character follow these steps:

Step 1: Choose Technique
First, the Sword-Singer must choose a technique to utilize. They 
may only choose a technique that they have learned and meet 
the requirements for. A character must be wielding a sword of 
some kind in order to utilize techniques.

Step 2: Make Technique Test
Next, the character makes a Shehai Shen She Ru skill (WP) 
skill test. This test is modified by the techniques difficulty as 
specified in the techniques profile.

Step 3: Resolve Technique
If the technique test was successful, apply the effects of the 
technique as specified in the techniques profile. If the character 
failed the technique test, they lose X Stamina Points, where 
X is equal to the 10s digit of the Techniques difficulty (to a 
minimum of 1 Stamina Point).

Techniques
This section gives an overview of each technique of Aberrant 
Swordsmanship that a character may learn. A character can only 
use techniques that they meet the requirements for. Characters 
who meet these requirements may learn techniques with XP. 
Remember that techniques count as magic, though they are 
not spells, and should thus be placed in the appropriate section 
of your character sheet.

Thirty-Eight Grips
Type: Passive (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)
Cost: 200 XP
Effect: At the beginning of a round during combat, the character 
may choose to have one of the following effects apply until the 
beginning of the next round:

            The character receives an additional DoS on successful 

attack tests made with Shehai Shen She Ru.

            The character receives an additional DoS on successful 

defense tests made with Shehai Shen She Ru.

  Attacks the character makes have the Impaling quality.
  Attacks the character makes have the Splitting (2) quality.
  Attacks the character makes gain Crushing (2) quality.

The Seven Hundred and Fifty Offensive Positions
Type: Passive
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Novice)
Cost: 100 XP
Effect: The sword-singer treats all attack tests made with Shehai 
Shen She Ru that ties against a defender as having scored an 
additional degree of success.

The Eighteen Hundred Defensive Positions
Type: Passive
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Novice)
Cost: 100 XP
Effect: The sword-singer treats all defense tests made with Shehai 
Shen She Ru that ties against an attacker as if the opponent 
failed their test instead.

The Nearly Nine Thousand Moves
Type: Passive
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)
Cost: 200 XP
Effect: Once per round, if the character fails an attack or defense 
test made with Shehai Shen She Ru, they may reroll the test 
(but they must accept the new result).

The Ephemeral Feint
Breathe in and then forget the breath; you cannot replace it until 
he is down, to fight as if dead: second principle of pneumansu.
Type: Active (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Apprentice)
Cost: 200 XP
Difficulty: +0, with a -10 imposed for each activation of this 
ability beyond the first per Long Rest. 
Effect: The character can activate this technique after being 
successfully attacked by a melee, ranged, or bolt form spell attack. 
This technique is activated as a free action before the character 
declares a defensive reaction. The character then immediately 
makes a Shehai Shen She Ru test with the appropriate difficulty.

201

If successful, the character reduces the DoS of the attackers 
attack roll by the DoS on the Shehai Shen She Ru test. If the 
attackers DoS are reduced to 0 or less, they count as having 
failed their attack. The character can then choose to declare a 
defensive reaction if they wish, as normal.

The Zero-Sum Interrupt
(...) I would prefer to imagine that you could. It would mean 
that I would bleed prior to the cut itself, bypassing all healing; 
moreso, and this is what pleases me utmost... it would mean that 
I have indeed helped you.
Type: Active (Primary Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)
Cost: 400 XP
Difficulty: -20 
Effect: Before the technique test, the character chooses a target 
within melee range. On success they may immediately make a 
standard melee attack against the target as a free action, using 
the results of their technique test in place of their attack test. 
For the purposes of resolving this attack, the target does not 
benefit from any Armour, Natural Toughness, or Resistances 
and the characters weapon gains the Magic quality.

The Havoc Canal
Cyrus moved to Havoc Canal, and Vivec nodded. Better. Your 
build favors that. But what if Ive enchanted my skin to harden 
at each instance?
Type: Active (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)
Cost: 300 XP
Difficulty: -20 
Effect: This technique is activated as a free action before a melee 
attack. On the characters next successful standard melee attack 
this turn they can choose a hit location for the attack. If the 
attack test succeeds with more than five degrees of success, the 
character can immediately make another standard melee attack 
as a free action, which is automatically resolved against the 
chosen hit location. This second attack cannot be defended 
against but cannot gain advantages. These attacks are resolved 
simultaneously, so any advantages from the initial attack do not 
apply when resolving the bonus attack. This bonus attack does 
not count against the usual limit of attacks per round.

The Tempest Attrition
Cyrus drew his saber, holding it left-handed in the Tempest 
Attrition. Vivec was impressed and said so. That stance allows 
you a riposte, he said. Then he smiled again. If youre quick 
enough.
Type: Passive (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)
Cost: 300 XP
Effect: This technique must be activated as a free action at the 
beginning of a round and its effect remains until the end of that 
round. The character takes a -20 penalty to attack tests made 
with Shehai Shen She Ru for the duration. In exchange they 
gain a +20 bonus on defense tests (including Counter Attacks) 
made with Shehai Shen She Ru.

The Fingers-Knife
The Fingers-Knife serves as five, protecting your cardinal points 
and your central theory; five thrusts, spaced microseconds apart, 
like tapping the desk bored, waiting for morning bread.
Type: Active (Primary Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Expert)
Cost: 500 XP
Difficulty: -20
Effect: Before the technique test, character chooses a target 
within melee range. On success the character may immediately 
make a standard melee attack against target opponent as a free 
action, using the results of the technique test in place of the 
attack test. When resolving the attack, roll for damage five 
times and use the largest result. This does not stack with the 
Proven Weapon Quality or the Savage Trait. The target of this 
attack may not attack the character until the beginning of his 
(the characters) next turn.

The Gaze of Confusion
Paint fake eyes all over your face and then hide your real ones 
among them; the opponent can no longer read where you look.
Type: Passive (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)
Cost: 300 XP
Effect: This technique must be activated at the beginning of a 
round and its effect remains until the end of that round. Other 
characters must pass a +0 Perception or Observe test in order 
to be able to perform a defensive reaction in response to the 
Sword-Singers attacks.

202

The Threat of Mirrors
Using the Math Athlete, you could occur several places during a
single duel, illustrious and sure.
Type: Passive (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)
Cost: 400 XP
Effect: This technique must be activated at the beginning of a 
round and its effect remains until the end of that round. Other 
characters must pass a Perception or Observe test with a -20 
penalty before being allowed make attacks or reactions against 
the Sword-Singer each time they wish to do so. The Sword-Singer 
then loses a Stamina Point when the effect ends.

The Vectoring Cygnet
Arm out, knee down, coal on the teeth to hide your smile.
Type: Active (Free Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)
Cost: 300 XP
Difficulty: Variable
Effect: This technique is activated as a free action, but only before 
a standard melee attack. The sword-singer chooses the penalty 
of the test. The target of the characters next successful melee 
attack cannot react to that attack unless he passes a Perception or 
Observe test with a penalty equal to the penalty the swordsinger 
chose for the technique.

The Bone Shaver
Bellguard down, over, hold. Strike at 80 grams, any degree but 
this one.
Type: Active (Primary Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Adept)
Cost: 400 XP
Difficulty: -10 per X
Effect: The swordsinger selects a target in melee range and tests 
this technique, choosing the penalty of the test. If successful, the 
character can immediately make a melee attack against the target 
as a free action using Shehai Shen She Ru. The swordsinger can 
choose the hit location freely. The targets wound threshold is 
reduced by X for the purposes of resolving this attack.

The Sword Tremor
Vivec spun in midair cross-legged, never moving his swordarm 
from its initial position. Fa-Nuit-Hen, the name of an old 
master, and Cyrus fell from eight wounds that appeared without 
mortal notice. Point down, blade edge forward, 60 degrees rise-
wise from the ground.
Type: Active (Primary Action)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Master)
Cost: 800 XP
Difficulty: -50
Effect: Before the technique test, the character chooses a target 
within a number of meters equal to twice their Willpower bonus. 
The Sword-Singer may immediately make a standard melee 
attack against that target as a free action (even if they are not 
engaged in melee).

The attack may not be defended against, and no characters can 
make any other type of reaction to this attack.

If the initial attack is successful, the character may make another 
free attack with the same conditions, although this attack cannot 
gain advantages and is made at a -20 penalty. These bonus attacks 
can be repeated (each successful one prompting another) up to 
a maximum number of bonus attacks equal to the swordsingers 
Willpower bonus. Each attack receives an additional, stacking 
-20 penalty (-20, then -40, then -60, and so forth). None of these 
attacks, including the first, can win Advantage. These bonus 
attacks do not count against the maximum attacks per round.

Walled Consequence Stance
Cyrus merely nodded and lifted up, bandaged across his eight wounds, 
and the sugarcat hissed at the needless movement. Startled by the 
sound, the young ansu took a Walled Consequence stance.
Type: Active (Reaction)
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Expert)
Cost: 200 XP
Difficulty: -20
Effect: This technique may be activated as a reaction to another 
characters use of a Shehai technique directed at the character. On 
success, the character may attempt a defensive reaction for free 
against an attack that would otherwise be impossible to defend 
against as a result of that technique. If the opponents Shehai 
Shen She Ru technique allows them to make multiple attacks, 
the swordsinger can make a defensive reaction to each of them 
for free. Additionally, every successful defensive reaction made 
against an enemy Shehai users techniques forces the attacker 
to immediately lose one Stamina Point.

203

Sword Tremor Sense
We know of you, Surahoon, and motions were multiplied the other 
morning on this beach, which is sword tremor, which we can feel, 
and that can only mean you encountered the Ansu-Gurleth.
Type: Passive
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Journeyman)
Cost: 300 XP
Difficulty: -20
Effect: The character gains the Unnatural Senses (Shehai 
Techniques, X) trait, where X is the characters Willpower bonus 
multiplied by one thousand.

The Pankratosword
But this is forbidden. Arc the bones that otherwise cannot bend.
Type: Active
Requires: Shehai Shen She Ru (Master)
Effect: The Pankratosword does not require a test to use: if the 
character has learned the technique, they may use it. Before 
the technique is activated, the character chooses any target. is 
may be something uncuttable, such as a place, thing, memory, 
concept, and so forth. There are no practical limits to what may 
be targeted with the Pankratosword. When the technique is 
activated the character dies and the target is destroyed. Exactly 
what this means in practical terms is left to the GM, who should 
keep in mind that the powers at work in any use of this technique 
are indescribably vast.

Typically, no effect can allow a character to survive the use of this 
technique. However it is not impossible given the right mythic 
circumstances (see the text Tiber Septims Sword-Meeting with 
Cyrus the Restless). The GM can, in certain exceptional cases, 
allow a character to survive at great cost.

Important Note: The Pankratosword is the pinnacle of 
Aberrant Swordsmanship: it is a forbidden technique 
that allows a Sword-Singer to draw on pure Creatia, 
the material of creation. It allows the Sword-Singer 
to bend the Earth-Bones themselves in order to alter 
reality, channeling pure energy through themselves as a 
catalyst, ultimately enabling them to cut the uncutta-
ble. This technique is forbidden because its use resulted 
in the destruction of Yokuda, the ancient Redguard 
homeland, and it has been lost ever since. Rules for 
the pankratosword are provided here primarily as a 
guide and reference for the GM. The Pankratosword 
is not something that should be treated lightly. If either 
the GM or the players were not familiar with Shehai 
before reading this section of this supplement, then they 
shouldnt be using it without first doing further research.

Shehai Talents
 These talents enhance the characters use of the abilities granted 
to them by the Way of the Spirit Sword. In order to purchase 
or use any of these talents, a character must first possess the 
Sword-Singer elite advance.

when using the Shehai.

  Radiant:  The character can, as a free action, change the 
composition of their Shehai. When they do this, hits with 
the Shehai count as sunlight.

action, change the composition of their Shehai. When they 
do this, hits with the Shehai deal fire damage.

  Concussive: Characters Shehai gains the Concussive 

quality.

  Electrifying: The character can, as a Secondary Cast Magic 
action, change the composition of their Shehai. When they 
do this, hits with the Shehai deal Shock damage.

of the Slashing trait.

  Quicksilver: Characters Shehai gains the Silvered quality.

enemy Wound Thresholds as being one lower than normal.
  Tearing: If the characters Shehai deals damage after miti-

gation, the target gains the Bleeding (1) condition.

  Thirsting: Attacks with the characters Shehai have the 

Proven trait.

  Venomous: The character can, as a free action, change the 
composition of their Shehai. When they do this, hits with 
the Shehai deal poison damage.

Our people once were artisans, poets, and scholars, but 
the ever evolving strife made the way the sword inevitable 
- the song of the blade through the air, through flesh and 
bone, its ring against armor: an answer to our prayers.  

-Redguards, Their History, and Their Heroes

The Shehai
The Shehai, or Spirit Sword, is at the same time an integral part 
of sword-singing, and something separate from it. The Shehai 
is not needed for the techniques of Aberrant Swordsmanship, 
but the same process used to shape the world through Aberrant 
Swordsmanship is used to manifest the Shehai. A sword-singer 
who can manifest the Shehai is known as an Ansei, or Saint 
of the Sword.

The Shehai itself is an incorporeal weapon, ranging from a barely 
defined misty shape, to a fantastical sword of pure thought. There 
are a total of three levels at which a Shehai may be manifested, 
and the form in which it manifests is shaped by its user.

Manifesting the Shehai
In game terms, the Shehai may be manifested in structured 
time with the use of the Cast Magic Secondary action and a 
Shehai Shen She Ru (WP) skill test, the difficulty of which will 
vary with the desired Shehai level. Characters must have the 
appropriate talent in order to manifest a Shehai of a given level.
  Manifesting a Shehai of the First Level Requires: a Shehai 
Shen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -10 penalty. Failing the 
manifestation roll costs the Swordsinger a Stamina Point.
  Manifesting a Shehai of the Second Level Requires: a Shehai 
Shen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -30 penalty. Failing the 
manifestation roll costs the Swordsinger two Stamina Points.
  Manifesting a Shehai of the third Level Requires: a Shehai 
Shen She Ru (WP) skill test with a -60 penalty. Failing 
the manifestation roll costs the Swordsinger three Stamina 
Points. On success, the character manifests the Shehai in 
an open hand. The weapon type of the manifested Shehai 
is determined in advance when the character purchases 
the necessary talent. A Shehai persists until the character 
dismisses it, or for a number of hours equal to the characters 
Willpower bonus minus the level of the Shehai.

A Shehai cannot be taken from the character in any way, and 
it may not be thrown without dissipating, as it is bound by his 
will. The Shehai is transparent, but is very much capable of 
interacting with physical objects: it can make attacks, applies all 
weapon qualities normally, and be defended against normally.

Shehai of the First Level
A Shehai of this level may vaguely resemble a certain weapon,
but it is very weak. Use the base weapon profile for the chosen 
weapon type, but add half the characters unmodified (by spells, 
enchantments, alchemy, or any other sources) Willpower bonus 
(round up) to the  damage, and give the weapon the Magic and 
Primitive qualities.

Shehai of the Second Level
A Shehai of this level is clearly a weapon, and is quite potent. 
Use the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but add 
the characters unmodified (by spells, enchantments, alchemy, 
or any other sources) Willpower bonus to the damage of the 
weapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.

Shehai of the Third Level
A Shehai of this level is a legendary weapon of incredible power. 
Use the base weapon profile for the chosen weapon type, but 
add twice the characters unmodified (by spells, enchantments, 
alchemy, or any other sources) Willpower bonus to the damage 
of the weapon, and give the weapon the Magic quality.

Storm Voice

The character, through talent and rigorous training, possesses the 
skill and power neccessary to wield the reality shaping powers of 
the Thuum.
Costs 1000 XP if a Nord or being trained, otherwise 1500 XP.
The character gains the ability to train the Thuum skill, learn 
Words of Power, and use them in Shouts.

The Thuum, also called the Storm Voice or simply the Voice, is 
a form of magic inherent in most Nords and some others which 
uses the words of the language of the Dragons to form Shouts, 
the equivalent of spells, of immense power. The word actually 
means shout in the Dragon language. The Nords believe that 
Kyne, the embodiment of the wind who is viewed as the Nordic 
aspect of Kynareth, breathed onto the land at the Throat of the 
World to form them. As such, the Nords believe that their voice 
and breath is their very essence, and that channeling this life 
essence is how the Thuum operates. Those who can wield this 
power are called Tongues by the Nords.

Skill: Thuum (Wp)
Example Specializations: Linguistics, War-Shouts, Lore
The Thuum skill reflects a characters potency of using their 
Voice, as well as their knowledge of the dragon tongue and their 
ability to read and decipher draconic runes. Your GM may ask 
you to test Thuum when:

  Attempting to understand or translate draconic runes and 

markings.

  Attempting to write in draconic script.
  Attempting to Shout.

Characters who have Dovahzul as a language alongside the 
Thuum skill need not make a thuum test to speak, write or 
understand it.

Learning Words of Power
Characters with the Thuum skill trained may unlock the ability 
to use a given word of power with XP assuming that they have 
somehow learned the word of power during their adventures 
(meaning that the GM has control over which words the char-
acter may access at any given time).

This represents the time spent to come to understand the nature 
of the word, and the practice required to be able to utilize it in 
a Shout. Learning a given word of power without aid of some 
kind costs 200 XP times the level of the Word (for example, the 
first word in a Shout would be 200 XP, the second 400 XP, etc.). 
Characters who have access to a guide (a teacher, an ancient text, 
or some other aid) during this process halve the cost.

trained in the Thuum skill, and have knowledge of a Word of 
Power. Words of power make up Shouts, which are similar to 
spells.

Characters may use Shouts with the Cast Magic Primary action. 
It is important to note, however, that using a Shout as a Cast 
Magic action does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity.

Additionally, theres more to using the Thuum than just saying 
a few words: Shouting requires concentration and power. Each 
Shout has three words, and while speaking the first word is 
sufficient to produce an effect, each additional word adds more 
power to the Shout (but also requires more skill and energy to 
use).

Once a character uses a Shout, they may not use that Shout 
again until after a number of rounds equal to the number 
of words used in the Shout.

Shouting
In structured time, shouts are utilized with the Cast Magic 
action. The following steps detail exactly how to use shouts:

Step 1: Choose Shout and Target
First, the character must declare the shout being used (specifically 
the number of words), and the target of the shout (if applicable). 
A character may only use a shout if they know the first word of 
that shout, and they may only use further words if they know 
those as well.

Step 2: Make Thuum Test
Next, the caster makes a Thuum skill test, the difficulty of 
which is determined by the shout the character has chosen. If 
the character passes the test, they successfully manifest the shout. 
If they fail, nothing happens. Either way, proceed to step 3.

Step 3: Spend Stamina
Attempting a shout takes a lot of energy, and the character is left 
drained afterwards. Characters who attempt a shout must spend 
one Stamina Point for each word used in the shout beyond the 
first. If a character fails a Shout, regardless of the number of 
words in the Shout, they lose one Stamina Point.

Step 4: Apply Effects
If the Thuum test was successful, apply the effects of the shout 
to the target as specified in the shout profile, and based on the 
number of words the character used.

Thuum Talents

Using the Thuum
Using the Thuum requires two things: the character must be 

Adept of the Voice
The character has gained substantial control over their Thuum.

206

Adept (Willpower)
The character is allowed to Test Endurance to not spend a 
Stamina Point for the second word in a shout, but the third 
word still costs a Stamina Point to use.

Prudent Voice
The character understands the power of understanding and 
restraint, making him capable of using his Voice in more subtle 
ways.
Expert (Willpower)
Requires: Adept of the Voice
The character can utilize his voice in subtle ways to affect 
the world around him. By making a simple +0 Thuum test, 
the Tongue can affect something that he can see within his 
Willpower Bonus in meters with any effect that could be 
caused by one of the words he knows, like igniting something 
easily flammable by using the word for fire, Yol, or cause 
something small to move by using the word for force, Fus.

What the tongue can and cannot do with this talent is up 
to the GM, but the effect is generally small and innocuous, 
though it is still apparent to those nearby that the Tongue 
is using his Voice.

Master of the Voice
The character has gained total control over their Thuum.
Master (Willpower)
Requires: Adept of the Voice
The character can now use the second word of a shout without 
spending a Stamina Point. Additionally, they may make a +0 
Endurance test to not spend a Stamina Point for the Third 
Word in a shout.

Voice of the Ancients
The characters speech becomes too powerful for mortals to behold, 
as the world trembles under the power of his Voice.
Master (Willpower)
Requires: Master of the Voice
Through meditating upon the true meaning of speech, the 
characters voice has become too powerful for mere mor-
tals. Shouts that inflict damage add the Tongues WB to the 
damage inflicted, and any shout that can be resisted adds a 
-10 penalty to doing so (after any modifiers chosen).

Additionally, the character can speak with their full voice 
to gain +20 on Intimidation tests made while doing so. In 
combat, they can use a Secondary Action and 1 SP to force all 
characters who can hear them clearly to make an Endurance 
test. Those who fail gain the Dazed condition until the end 
of their next turn.

Shouts

This section contains a number of shouts that characters 
with the Voice may learn. Keep in mind that these are just 
some of the ways that the Voice may be used, and no single 
list can capture the true power and flexibility of this ancient 
art.  Players  and  GMs  are  encouraged  to  work  together 
to create their own shouts as they see fit, or to allow char-
acters to utilize the Thuum skill in more creative ways. 

The effects listed here are for the full sequence of words leading 
up to the chosen word, not just that word alone, though for 
simplicitys sake we will refer to the individual words and not 
the whole phrase.

All shouts are audible within a 50m radius or the affected radius, 
whichever is larger.

If the shout is marked with the Whisper keyword, the Tongue 
may choose to make the shout only audible within 1m instead.

The Attack keyword indicates that using the shout counts toward 
the maximum number of attacks per round.

Your Thuum cuts through flesh and shatters soul, commanding the 
will of the fallen.
Attack (2nd and 3rd Word)
Difficulty: -30, -10 for each word beyond the first. 

R3 Rii : Essence
Character chooses a number of targets equal to the characters 
WB within 25m. If any of these targets die within 1 minute, 
their soul is trapped within an appropriate empty soul gem 
of the characters within 1m of the character.
V1Z Vaaz : Tear
Same as Rii, except it also halves the targets max HP for 1 
minute. If a targets current HP is higher than their new max 
HP, their current HP is reduced to the new value and is not 
restored when the duration ends. 
ZOL Zol : Zombie
Same as Vaaz, except if a target dies during the shouts dura-
tion, their corpse rises to fight for the character for 5 minutes. 
It uses their character profile.

Words of Surety
The second shout made famous by Bhag the Raider, by weaving 
words of power into mundane sentences, known in the Sermons 
of Vivec as double-speak, he could convince even his most cunning 
opponents of his lies.
Whisper
Difficulty: -10, -20 for each word beyond the first. 

LO Lo : Deception
The character speaks one sentence that he wishes the target 
to believe as truth, no questions asked, and then rolls an 
Opposed Willpower test against the target. If the character 
succeeds, the target will believe what was just said, and not 
ask any questions that could ruin the belief in the lie.
V1Z Tinvaak : Conversation
Same as Lo, except the target gains a -20 penalty to the
Opposed Willpower Test.
BAHLOK Bahlok : Compulsion
As Tinvaak, except the target gains a -40 penalty to
the Opposed Willpower Test.

Songs of Destiny
Made famous by Barfok the Maid of Planes during the invasion 
of Morrowind, this shout allows a Tongue to decide the outcome of 
events around them by forcing their will upon mundus by constantly 
singing it in the Voice, forcing the very fates to obey.
Thuum Chant: This Shout is unique and is a literal song that 
must be repeated and continuously sung to keep reality bent to 
the Tongues will. It uses the same testing functions of normal 
Shouts, but costs triple the usual Stamina Points. Additionally, 
while a character is singing the Songs of Destiny Shout, they 
cannot use any other Shouts or speak normally and have their 
maximum AP reduced by 1. If the character stops singing the 
Song for any reason, its effects end immediately.
Difficulty: -20, -20 for each word beyond the first.

PRODAH Prodah : Unavoidable Fate
Before rolling the Thuum test, the character must state an 
event that will come to pass, like Today, we will taste vic-
tory against the Dunmeri. If successful, an area around the 
Tongue equal to the Tongues Willpower in meters is bent 
to their will.
While in this effected area, all those who would oppose the 
fate prophesied by the Tongue suffer a -10 penalty to all 
tests, and all those who seek to fulfill this prophecy gain a 
+10 bonus to all tests. This includes any tests that attempt to 
effect something inside the area of effect, even if the source 
of the effect is not in that same area.
D4N Daan : Prophecy
Same as Prodah, except the penalty and bonus to tests both 
become 20. Additionally, those within the area of effect who 
oppose the prophecy treat any skill check roll they make that 
is equal to one of the Tongues Lucky Numbers as a Critical 
Failure. Likewise, anyone seeking to fulfill the prophecy treats 
any skill check roll they make that is equal to one of the 
Tongues Lucky Numbers as a Critical Success.
M3R4D Miiraad : Choice
Same as Daan, except the penalty and bonus both become 
30. Additionally, those within area of effect who oppose the
prophecy treat any skill check roll they make that is equal to 
one  of the Tongues Lucky or Unlucky Numbers as a Critical 
Failure. Likewise, anyone seeking to fulfill the prophecy treats 
any skill check roll they make that is equal to one of the 
Tongues Lucky or Unlucky Numbers as a Critical Success.
Lastly, the Tongues grasp on destiny becomes so strong that 
anyone opposing the prophecy loses the ability to Burn Luck 
for any reason other than to avoid death, and anyone seeking 
to fulfill the prophecy reduces the permanent reduction of the 
Luck characteristic by 1 (to a minimum of 1) when burning 
Luck.

Thuum Rituals
The Thuum is an ancient art, having seen many aspects rise and 
fall through the ages. While the Words of Power are the most well 
known advantages of the Thuum, the Nords have discovered 
many ways to impose their will upon the world with their Voice.

Listed below is a ritual, detailing how the ancient Tongues 
could channel their Voice in a manner that has mostly become 
lost to time.

The Knotted Tongue (GRON SIK)
In the ages of old, Tongues would rip out the tongue of their greatest 
enemies, weave them into rope and imbue them with Speech. This 
would result in a sinewy rope, known as a Gron-Sik, meaning to 
bind words, that would contain a part of the Tongues own breath, 
giving it the power to Speak. Breathing life into the rope would 
give it strength, and the Tongue would tie knots on it to contain 
the breath within, unbinding a knot to unleash a part of its power. 
But breathing life into the rope was costly, requiring a part of the 
Tongues breath in order to stay alive.

The character then fills out the profile of the Gron-Sik
by writing down the following information:

  The chosen name for the Gron-Sik (Usually Gron-Sik of 

shout name).

  The word(s) of the chosen shout imbued in the Gron-Sik. 
  The amount of DoS scored in the Imbuement, hence-

forth known as Binding Strength.

  The word Ties and a blank space in which to note a 

number.

The Gron-Sik can be activated with the Cast Magic action, 
spending one if its Ties to power all words of the shout, which 
automatically counts as having succeeded with a number of DoS 
equal to its Binding Strength. If a shout requires an Opposed 
Roll, use the wielders Willpower Bonus.

To power the Gron-Sik, the Tongue must give it a Stamina Point 
for each Tie desired. This can be done as part of a Long Rest, 
but as long as the Stamina Points are Tied to the Gron-Sik, it 
cannot be recovered by any means, neither ordinary or magical.

The ritual allows the Tongue to imbue a ritually prepared rope 
of his enemies tongues with a part of his power, allowing him 
limited use of his Voice, even if otherwise prevented from doing 
so, like being on the brink of exhaustion or somehow robbed 
of the ability to speak.

Creating the Rope itself requires no test, but the creator must 
have the tongues of three powerful and worthy foes, fresh 
Heartwood from a Spriggan (Extremely Rare Restoration ingre-
dient) for smoking the meat, drying it out while giving it life, 
and Ice Wraith Essence (Very Rare Restoration / Destruction 
ingredient) to preserve it from rot.

With the rope created, it must next imbued with one or more 
words of power from a single non-Legendary shout that the 
Tongue knows. Choose the desired Word(s) of the Shout and 
perform the appropriate Thuum test as if using that shout, but 
with an added -10 penalty to each word beyond the first. If the 
test is successful, the raconic runes representing the word(s) 
of the shout appear on the length of rope, indicating that the 
ritual was a success. Regardless of the result of the test, all ritual 
ingredients are consumed except for the tongue itself.

Example
Gron-Sik of Fire Breath
(Yol; Binding Strength 2; Ties [2])

The above is a tongue rope that can be activated two times 
before needing to be recharged, that when used performs the 
word Yol, the first word of Fire Breath, with 2 automatic DoS.

Whos Tongues are Worthy?
What makes a worthy foe is subjective. The best course of action 
is simply to ask the GM if an opponent would be considered 
a worthy foe for the purpose of making a Gron-Sik, but as a 
general rule of Thuum, a worthy foe is a challenging opponent, 
often one that has served as a minor antagonist or worse, such 
as the lieutenants of an enemy army, great monsters such as 
giants or goblin kings, or most potently: other Tongues.

Tales of Kinship
The Warden knows the secret stories of Yffres creatures, and can 
weave themselves to become a part of them.
Journeyman (Willpower, Personality)
Requires: Tale of  Tongues
Any creature with the Bestial Trait that has been sufficiently 
calmed by the use of the Profession[Animal Training] skill 
or through the use of Beast Tongue can, over the course of a 
Long Rest, become the target of a ritual. This ritual requires 
50 drakes worth of ritual ingredients and 30 Magicka Points 
to strike a bargain with the spirits of Yffres sacred beasts.

At the conclusion of the ritual, the Warden and the target 
make an Opposed Willpower test. The Warden may spend an 
additional 30 Magicka Points to gain an additional Degree 
of Success on their test as many times as they are able. If the 
Warden wins this opposed test they can learn the Call of 
Nature(X) spell, where X is the targets creature type.

Tales of Brotherhood (X)
The Warden knows the ancient tales of Men, Mer and Beastfolk 
that befriended the fiercest beasts of Yffre.
Expert (Willpower, Personality)
Requires: Tales of  Kinship
The Character deepens the bond between one of their oath-
bound Beasts and themselves, turning it into a familiar. When 
this Talent is purchased, choose one creature type (X) that you 
have a bargain with. When the Warden summons this crea-
ture, they can choose to temporarily reduce their Maximum 
Magicka Pool by the Spell Cost for a number of days equal 
to their Personality Bonus. The familiar is summoned for as 
long as the Wardens Magicka Pool is reduced in this way.

If the familiar dies before this effect ends, the Wardens 
Magicka Pool is restored. Only one familiar can be summoned 
at any given time.

This talent can be purchased multiple times for each creature 
type (X).

WArden

The character has become a Warden after devoting themselves to 
the will of Yffre.
Costs 750 XP if a Bosmer or being trained, otherwise 1000 XP.
The character gains the ability to train Conte Yffre & Frostfall 
skills, learn and use Warden Spells and Talents.

The Tales of Yffre
The character gains the ability to train Conte Yffre & Frostfall 
skills, learn and use Warden Spells and Talents.

Skill: Conte Yffre (Willpower, Personality)
Example Specializations: Bears, Cliff Racers, Familiar
Striking pacts with beasts and plants alike, the Warden tells tales 
of natures warmth and compassion, its capacity for growth, or 
the wrath of nature scorned.
Your GM may ask you to test Conte Yffre when:

  Attempting to convey your intent to an animal.
  Attempting to gauge the state of nature around you.
  Attempting to use Conte Yffre spells or talents.

Skill: Conte Frostfall (Willpower, Personality)
Example Specializations: Same as Spell origin schools
Embodying the Frostfall, the Wardens tale unleashes the wrath 
of harsh winter; frost, blizzards and decay upon foes. Characters 
can utilize the Conte Frostfall (using Willpower or Personality) 
as if it were the relevant Magic School skill when casting or 
purchasing Conventional Spells with the [Frost] Attribute, or 
which deals Frost based damage.

Any talent that can affect the original spell still functions as if 
it was cast with the original School.

Warden Talents
These talents enhances the characters use of the abilities granted 
to them by the Conte. In order to purchase or use any of these 
talents, a character must first possess the Warden Elite Advance.

Tale of Tongues
The Warden knows the ancient tales of the secret tongues of birds 
and words of wolves.
Apprentice (Willpower, Personality)
By spending 5 Magicka, the Character can use the Beast Tongue 
Racial Ability of the Bosmer for a number of minutes equal to 
their Prs Bonus. If the character is a Bosmer they can use this 
talent at the same cost to ignore the Perception test to speak 
with unfamiliar animals entirely. The talent can be used this 
way before or after the test.

217

Tales of the Wild Hunt
The Warden has been bestowed the tale of ancient times where 
monsters were truly wild, unconstrained by the Green Pact, and 
can empower his familiar with this power.
Master (Willpower, Personality)
Requires: Tales of  Brotherhood (X)
The Characters Familiar summoned with the Tales of 
Brotherhood may gain the Wild Shape Racial Ability of the 
Bosmer: The Unglamoured on page 37, the effects of which 
are chosen upon the summoning of the Familiar. Additionally, 
the familiar gains the Magic quality on all attacks with its 
natural weapons. Lastly, if the familiar perishes from injury, 
the Warden can spend a Stamina Point and pay the cost of 
summoning the Familiar to magically restore it to full health. 
This can only be done once for each time the familiar is 
summoned.

Frozen Gate
The Warden tells the tales of people who went into the raging snow 
of the Frostfall, never to be seen again.
Journeyman (Willpower, Personality)
The Warden can test Conte Frostfall(+0) and spend 20 Magicka 
using a Cast Magic Secondary Action to create a portal of ice 
underneath a target character within 25 meters, causing the 
target to immediately appear on the ground before the caster 
within 3 meters. If a valid location is unavailable the effect fails 
automatically. On a successful cast, the Warden rolls Willpower 
opposed by the Targets Evade or Athletics skill if they want to 
avoid it. This counts as a 4th Level Spell.

Secluded Grove
Through Yffre, nature provides a sanctuary in which the Warden 
and their allies can rest deeply or in safety.
Adept (Willpower, Personality)
The Warden can choose to invoke the natures spirits to
provide comfort or safety, within the confines of a small
natural area. Calling upon this boon costs 5 Magicka for a Short 
rest and 15 Magicka for a long rest, spent upon completion of 
the rest.
Choose one of the following:

  Comfort: The Warden and their allies double the effects 
gained from a Long or Short rest taken in the defined 
area. A character can choose to forgo this benefit to 
instead treat a single Wound of the characters choice.
  Safety: The Warden and their allies will not be disturbed 
by any wildlife with the Bestial trait during their sleep. 
Additionally, they count as if they had the Light Sleeper 
Talent. If they already have this talent, they instead gain 
a +20 bonus to their Observe test for the purposes of 
noticing potential threats.

Conte Yffre Spells
This section contains a number of spells for the Conte Yffre 
skill that Wardens may learn through their innate connection 
with Yffre, Lord of the Wild.

These spells have no associated individual spell effects and, as 
such, cannot be used for enchantments, unconventional spells,  
or alchemy.

New Spell Attribute: Natural
Only targets standing on a surface that could sustain natural life 
in some capacity, such as a forest floor, a dirt road, or a riverbed, 
can be affected by this spell.

Summons a bestial creature with the Summoned and Bound 
traits, which appears within five meters of the caster. The sum-

Keeping the animal apparition manifested in the world imposes 
[Spell Str] Mindlock on the caster. Roll initiative for the creature 
when its summoned as it acts on its own turn. If the spell 
ends because the caster chooses not to upkeep this spell, the 
creature loses the Summoned and Bound traits and returns to

Child of the Night Talents

The character has embraced their vampiric nature, succumbing to 
the thirst and accepting their new life as a creature of the night.
Requires that the character be a vampire
Costs 750 XP if taken under a masters wing, otherwise 
1000 XP.
Characters who take this elite advance gain access to the talents 
and other character options included in this section. They also 
immediately gain the following traits, overwriting as applicable:

  Sun-Scarred (3)
  Dawn-Cursed (2)
  Resist Normal Weapons (3)
  Natural Weapons (Fangs, 1d8 Splitting, Magic)

According to their vampiric bloodline, they also gain access to 
one of the following Powers which can be activated once per day:

Cyrodilic: Vampiric Seduction
As a Secondary Action, the vampire can charm a non-hos-
tile target within 10m. The target makes a +0 Wp test to 
resist the effect. If this test is successful, they become aware 
that theyve been affected by some kind of magic. If they 
fail, they become affected by a level 4 Charm Spell Effect.

Aundae: Dark Magic of the Mind
The gaze of the Aundae can invoke a primal fear and mad-
ness  from  their  enemies.  As  a  Primary  Attack  Action, 
the  vampire  can  cause  a  target  within  15m  to  either 
make a +0 Horror test. Alternatively, they can cause the 
target to test Wp, gaining the Frenzied Trait on a failure.

Quarra: Might of the Grave
As a Secondary Action, the vampire may spend 1 SP to 
gain +2 to their strength bonus and increase the damage die 
of their natural weapons by one dice step  for 10 minutes.

Berne: Embrace of Shadows
While in Dim light or Darkness, the vampire may turn invisible until 
they attack, cast a spell, or come within 3m of a bright light source.

Volkihar: Freezing Breath
While grappling a target, the vampire may breathe into them 
as a Primary Attack Action, freezing them from within. The 
target takes 1d6 Frost damage and must make a +10 Endurance 
test, becoming Paralyzed on failure. On a success, they are only 
affected by the Slowed trait for 1 hour. Either effect is ended 
after 1 hour or until they take any amount of Fire damage.

Vampiric Domination
Do as I command, and you will reap the rewards. Defy me, and I 
can offer you only pain and suffering.
Expert (Personality), Requires the Cyrodilic Bloodline
The vampires Vampiric Seduction power now applies a level 7 
Charm Spell Effect. Additionally, the target suffers a -20 to the 
Wp test to resist. The vampire may also select a single target for 
this ability to affect indefinitely until the vampire releases them 
at will. Each time the indefinite target of the power is damaged 
they can re-test their roll to resist.

Darkness of the Subconscious
Your mind is naked to me! I can taste your fear! You are fertile 
ground for the seeds of eternal torment!
Expert (Willpower), Requires the Aundae Bloodline
The vampire can read the deepest thoughts of any target affected 
by their Dark Magic of the Mind power. Additionally, when 
they use the power to apply the Frenzied condition, they may 
choose the target of the frenzied characters attacks.

Savagery of the Grave
Draw upon the wrath of the lord of domination and tear their 
flesh from bone!
Expert (Strength), Requires the Quarra Bloodline
The vampire gains the Savage trait. Additionally, they add an 
additional point of damage for each stamina point spent to Power 
Attack. Lastly, when making unarmed attacks, they can choose 
between the Splitting or Slashing weapon qualities.

One with the Shadow
Blend into the shadows and feast upon sanguine bliss!
Expert (Agility), Requires the Berne Bloodline
The vampires Embrace of Shadows power can be used even in 
bright light as long as there is some level of shadow they can hide 
in. While invisible from the use of this power, their movement 
makes no sound.

Volkihar Necromancy
Even the dead must answer to the will of the Volkihar!
Expert (Willpower), Requires the Volkihar Bloodline
The vampire may spend 1 SP and 2 AP to reanimate the corpse 
of a large or smaller creature within 10m for 3 rounds, as if it 
were affected by a Reanimation spell effect. Doing so imposes 
Mindlock(1) for as long as the corpse remains animated or until 
the vampire chooses to end the effect. If the duration would end, 
the vampire may spend 1 SP and 1 AP to instead maintain it 
for another 3 rounds. When the effect ends or the reanimated 
corpse dies, they dissipate into a pile of ash.

master by being targeted by a successful level 4 or higher Dispel 
effect or through the death of their master.

Rite of Sanguine Preservation
Vampires proficient in this process can create blood potions to 
sustain themselves when fresh prey is scarce. Creating a potion 
of blood  requires a clean phial made of pure crystal, a cutting 
implement, a rare Restoration ingredient, a creature with a 
black soul as a source for blood, and the knowledge of the 
procedure itself.

The target must either be helpless or a willing participant for 
the duration of this 5 minute process. The vampire first must 
extract the blood from the victim into the crystal phial, dealing 
the chosen cutting implements base damage which bypasses any 
AR and reduces the targets Endurance by 10 until after their 
next Long Rest. Then, the rare restoration ingredient must be 
skillfully mixed with the blood by passing an alchemy test as 
if this were a level 4 potion. See Step 4 for creating potions on 
page 148. If the test fails, then the blood spoils and the phial 
must be cleaned before making another attempt. In either case, 
the used restoration ingredient is consumed.
When consumed, the blood within this phial sates the vampires 
thirst for a day.

Rite of Undeath: Death Hound
Vampires who are proficient in necromancy can uncover the 
secret of the creation of the Death Hound. This ritual follows 
the base rules for the Rite of Undeath on page 150, with the 
following rules for specifically the Death Hound:

Death Hounds require 75 Magicka to raise, and require 30 
minutes of ritual time. A Death Hound requires a wolf sized 
body though it doesnt necessarily need to be a wolf. A large cat 
or other hound will work just fine. A Death hound must have 
its body intact, cannot have died with an unhealed wound, and 
must be properly prepared. Then, the blood of a vampire must 
be somehow introduced into the corpses body.
A character can raise multiple Death Hounds at once as a pack, 
adding +25 Magicka and requiring a fully prepared corpse for 
each additional Death Hound. Every five Death Hounds added 
in this way imposes a -10 on the Necromancy test to perform 
the ritual.

Supernatural Reflexes
You have unlocked the ability to move at such a speed and with 
such precision that few can act before your fangs are sunken in 
their throats.
Master (Agility)
The vampire improves their Initiative Rating by 2, gains a +10 
bonus to all Evade tests, and increases their movement speed by 2.

Undead Fortitude
You have come to realize that your organs are little more than a 
relic from older days.
Adept (Endurance)
The vampire either gains the Tough (1) trait or increases their 
existing Tough trait by 1. Additionally, they either gain the 
Resilient (2) trait or increase their Resilient trait by 2.

Vampiric Secrets
The rules contained within this section represent secrets held by 
powerful vampires. They cannot be purchased with XP  instead, 
they must be learned from the few people or tomes who contain 
this forbidden knowledge.

Rituals
Enthralling Rite
Vampires who practice this rite are able to turn unwilling prey 
into devout servants through the power of profane blood magic. 
This ritual requires no components except for a cutting imple-
ment and knowledge of the rite itself.

First, the target of the ritual must be restrained in some fashion 
for the duration of the 10 minute ritual. Then, using a cutting 
implement of their choice, the vampire must slice themselves, 
dealing the appropriate damage from the item used to make 
the cut, which bypasses AR.

Then they must forcefully feed their blood to the target over the 
course of the remainder of the ritual. For the next ten minutes, 
the vampire and their potential thrall are locked in a battle of 
wills as the vampire chants daedric rites of domination and sub-
servience. The two must each make an extended Willpower test, 
making each individual test simultaneously. The first character 
to reach 15 DoS wins this battle of wills. If the vampire wins the 
test, the target of the ritual successfully becomes the vampires 
thrall; otherwise, the target becomes immune to this ritual for 
1 week. A vampire can keep a number of thralls in their service 
equal to their WB.

A vampire thrall willingly and enthusiastically follows the com-
mands of their master. However, for as long as they are enthralled, 
their Intelligence is halved and the vampire should give them 
direct and specific instructions lest they misinterpret the intent 
of their masters words. A thrall is freed from the will of their

Vampiric Spellcasting
There are two forms of vampiric spellcasting; Nox Arcana and 
Hemomancy. They do not follow the same rules as standard 
spellcasting, but are still activated using Cast Magic actions. 
Only vampires have a connection to the daedric energies 
required to cast these spells.
To learn the skill associated with either requires that the char-
acter have the Child of the Night Elite Advance and gain the 
knowledge from a tome or vampire who has knowledge of them, 
which grants them the skill at rank 0 (Novice). From there, the 
skill can be advanced as normal with XP - however, only one 
may be advanced to rank 5 (Master).
Learning a legendary spell from either doctrine requires that 
the vampire has the associated skill trained to rank 5 (Master).

Nox Arcana (Wp)
Commonly called night magic, Nox Arcana is an ancient power 
that few vampires still have in recent generations.
Gaining one of the Nox Arcana spells below requires that the 
vampire feed on the blood of another vampire and spend 100 XP.
Using a Nox Arcana spell requires that the vampire pass a Nox 
Arcana skill test. Any associated SP cost is not spent on a failure.

Shrouding Mist
Cost: 1 AP + 1 SP
Casting Time: 5 minutes
The vampire calls upon the eternal darkness to cause the sur-
rounding area in a 2 kilometer radius to be consumed by a 
heavy fog. This imposes a -10 penalty to all Observe tests and 
any vampire within the area has their Dawn-Cursed trait value 
reduced by 1 for as long as the fog remains. The fog lasts for 
5 hours and cannot be ended early unless affected by a more 
powerful magic.

Bat Form
Cost: 1 AP + 1 SP
The Vampire becomes a swarm of bats. They gain the Flyer (10) 
trait, change their size to Tiny (-20 to hit by larger characters or 
at range), and reduce their max HP to 5. The effect ends after 
3 rounds unless the character spends 1 SP, which refreshes the 
effect for another 3 rounds. The spell ends immediately and 
the vampire reverts to their true form if the HP is reduced to 0.

Night Cloak
Cost: 2 AP + 1 SP
The vampire summons a swarm of bats which inflicts 1d6 Poison 
damage to all hostile creatures in a 2m radius at the end of each 
of the vampires next 3 turns, starting on the current turn. The 
vampire then regains an amount of health equal to the total 
damage dealt after mitigation.

Eclipse
Legendary
Cost: 3 SP
Over the course of 30 minutes, the vampire calls upon the 
powers of domination to eclipse the sun, limiting exposure to its 
searing light. The surrounding area within 8 km of the vampire 
is shaded from the sun, and vampires within it are unaffected 
by their Dawn-Cursed trait for the next 2 hours.

Black Shadow
Legendary
Cost: 1 AP + 2 SP
The vampires shadow becomes disconnected from them while 
this spell is active. The detached shadow gains the stats of a 
Gloom Wraith and acts as a summoned creature, doing the 
vampires bidding. The Gloom Wraith stays summoned for 5 
rounds, which can be refreshed for 2 SP. It also rolls its own 
initiative and acts independently in combat. If the Gloom 
Wraiths HP is reduced to 0 or becomes unsummoned, it is 
reattached to the vampire as their shadow.

Hemomancy (Wp)
Blood magic is a profane art known only to the most vile vampiric 
sorcerers.
Using a Hemomancy spell requires that the vampire pass a 
Hemomancy skill test. Regardless of the result, the full MP 
and AP cost is spent. Hemomancy spells cannot benefit from 
spell restraint.

Vampiric Drain
Cost: 1 AP + 11 MP
The vampire drains 2d6 magic damage to a target within 4m, 
restoring their own HP by the amount of damage successfully 
dealt (after any reduction). If this kills the target, the vampires 
thirst is sated for the day. If this spell is affected by a reflect spell 
or effect, it has no net effect.

Blood Grasp
Cost: 1 AP + 10 MP
The vampire forces a target within a 15m range to make a -10 
Str test. On a failure, the vampire can force the target to move 
up to 10m closer to them. This forced movement can trigger 
Attacks of Opportunity.

Sanguine Shield
Cost: 2 AP + 15 MP
The vampire creates a sanguine dome with a 3m radius centered 
on themself, protecting any character encompassed within. 
The dome has 30 HP and any source of damage targeting a 
character within it damages the dome instead. The dome has 
the Sun-Scarred (5) trait and cannot regain health by any means.

222

Crimson Sphere
Legendary
Cost: 3 AP + 20 MP
The vampire creates a 2m radius sphere made of blood which 
envelopes them, restoring 2d8 HP each round that they remain 
in the sphere. The sphere lasts for 3 rounds, has 50 HP, and 
takes all damage which targets the sphere or a character within 
it. If the sphere comes into contact with Sunlight or is dealt 
damage which counts as sunlight, it is immediately destroyed.

Consuming Blast
Legendary
Cost: 1 AP + 16 MP
The vampire launches a bolt of vampiric energy to a point within 
20m which explodes in a 3m radius, dealing 2d8 magic damage 
to those caught in the Area of Effect. The vampire regains HP 
equal to the damage dealt (after any reduction). If a target is 
killed as a result, the vampires thirst is sated for the day.

VAmPire lord

Mantle of the Lord
The vampire spends 2 AP  to assume the mantle of the vampire 
lord. Their body morphs and strengthens; sprouting wings and 
twisting the face into the visage of a monstrous humanoid 
bat. When they assume this mantle, all who see the grotesque 
transformation must make a Panic test. The vampire can revert 
back to their normal form at will.

threshold for their extended test is reduced to 10. Additionally, 
the requirement for a dispel effect to free their thralls is increased 
to a 6+ level Dispel effect.
The vampire can now see through the eyes and hear through 
the ears of their thralls whenever they wish, and their thralls no 
longer suffer the Int penalty involved with their enthrallment.

ShAdoW mAGic

The character has learned the secrets of the shadows and may wield 
Shadow Magic.
400 XP, and must complete a rite which grants the elite 
advance.
An obscure but powerful form of magic, Shadow Magic was 
discovered by Azra Nightwielder: the first mage to realize that 
shadow was not simply an absence of light, but a reflection of 
possible worlds created by forces in conflict.

Shadow Magic involves the manipulation of shadows in order 
to affect the forces creating it. Shadow mages can potentially 
change the past, present, and future in this way. Shadow Magic 
is most common around the border of Hammerfell, Skyrim and 
High Rock, and is rarely seen elsewhere.

Becoming a Shadow Mage
In  order  to  purchase  any  Shadow  Magic  talents,  have  a 
Convergence Rating, or utilize Congruence Powers or Rituals, 
a character must have the Shadow Mage elite advance. Becoming 
a Shadow Mage is a difficult and grueling endeavor, but once this 
journey is completed, the character gains access to possibilities 
that exist beyond the ordinary understanding of magicto 
wield the power of shadows and transcend the boundaries of 
light and darkness.

The path to becoming a Shadow Mage requires completing a 
ritual that binds the character to the shadows. This ritual not only 
opens their soul to shadow magic but also shapes the way they 
wield it, tying their power to one of three governing attributes: 
Intelligence, Perception, or Personality. These attributes reflect 
the unique approach and philosophy the character adopts in 
their mastery of shadow magic. These rituals are extremely rare 
and difficult to find. They are not common knowledge, and are 
generally only known to those who have undertaken the rituals 
themselves. Once found, learning and comprehending these 
rituals requires that the character pass a -20 lore test which, if 
failed, can be reattempted the following day.

Each of these rituals asks the character to make a test against 
themselves. This is achieved by the player making their own test 
while the GM makes a test using the same target number in 
secret. The two results are compared and resolved as a normal 
opposed test, and the opposed test is rerolled in the case of a 
tie. This test represents the struggle between the character and 
their alternate selves to complete the goal of the specific ritual.
Once a ritual is successfully completed, the character gains the 
Convergence Rating (1) trait.

225

The Rite of Secret Knowledge
The Rite of Secret Knowledge demands both intellectual rigor 
and a willingness to endure isolation from a prospective shadow 
mage. They must withdraw from all distractions, entering a 
state of solitary contemplation for one uninterrupted week. 
During this time, they create a unique booka vessel for their 
understanding of shadow magic.

In order to begin this ritual, the character must craft an obsidian 
tome with meticulous care. Doing so requires the use of paper, 
polished obsidian for the cover, and the hair of a creature with a 
black soul to bind the pages to the cover. Then, the prospective 
shadow mage must mix a small amount of their own blood into 
a pot of ink, a process that deals 1 damage to the character, to 
create the ink required to continue with this ritual. The material 
costs for these items are difficult to calculate, as  some of these 
components are not commonly available and may need to be 
harvested or found out in the world. However, once these items 
have been acquired, binding the pages onto the cover to create 
the book is not complex, but it is rather time-consuming. From 
start to finish, the process takes 8 hours of active work for the 
first time. For any subsequent times the character crafts this 
book, the duration required to complete this task is halved.
Contrary to the process of bookbinding, conducting the ritual 
itself  is far from straightforward. While the prospective shadow 
mage crafts their book, so do their shadows in an unknowable 
number. As such, the book is not a static creation  it is a conduit 
linking the character to alternate versions of their prospective 
selves linked by the shadows. Over the course of this rituals 
duration, the character  must scribe their knowledge into the 
book - an offering to their shadows - while obfuscating it and 
attempting to glean additional knowledge from the dark san-
guine ink that appears magically on the obsidian tomes pages. 
Each shadow attempts to obfuscate their own  knowledge while 
solving the riddles and overly-complex formulas entered into 
these pages by their alternates.

At the culmination of seven gruelling days of competitive study, 
the character must make an Opposed Intelligence test against 
themselves. If the character fails, the book is claimed by a shadow 
and is lost by the character completely.

Failure is not without its lessons, however; the prospective 
shadow mage gains a cumulative +10 bonus (only applied to 
the players character) to the opposed test of their next attempt. 
Once the character succeeds, they triumph over their alternates 
and can finally claim the book for themselves. By doing so, they 
complete the Rite of Secret Knowledge and gain the Shadow 
Magic Elite Advance using Intelligence as its governing char-
acteristic once they spend the required XP.

Rite of Penumbric Insight
Prospective Shadow Mages seeking to wield the power of the 
shadows through the use of their Perception must find a site of 
great conflict. This place must be the epicenter of some great 
calamity, turmoil, or tragedy. Before they begin this ritual, the 
character must ritually prepare their body by receiving a perma-
nent marking of an eye with obsidian dust as the main material. 
This eye must be at least the size of the characters own eyes. 
They must also come prepared with some sort of mind-altering 
substance which would alter or expand their perception of reality.
Once the prospective Shadow Mage arrives at their chosen 
location with the required materials for this ritual, they must 
choose a serene location at the site, imbibe the hallucinogen, 
and remain within the chosen location for the next 7 harrowing 
days. Over the course of this duration, the character will witness 
occurrences surrounding and leading up to the event associated 
with this site. The character must peer into and beyond these 
occurrences with the aid of the hallucinogen, attempting to 
witness alternate versions thereof. For example, at the site of 
a betrayal, the character might witness cooperation against a 
common foe instead. During this time, the character eats and 
takes rests as normal.

At the culmination of this seven day ritual, the character must 
make an opposed Perception test against themselves. On a failure, 
the marking of the eye which the character used for this ritual is 
still visible, but permanently closes. However, failure improves 
the characters ability to peer into the shadows of this place. They 
can begin the next attempt at this ritual with a cumulative +10 
bonus (which only applies to the player characters test) for the 
opposed test on the next attempt.

Once they succeed, the character has gained the ability to peer 
into the shadows beyond those of their own realm without 
alchemical assistance. As a result, they gain the Shadow Magic 
Elite Advance using Perception as its governing characteristic 
once they spend the required XP.

Rite of Dark Conspiracy
The Rite of Dark Conspiracy asks much of the prospective 
Shadow Mages force of character. Completing it requires that 
the character choose and bring with them an object, character, 
or creature of great importance to them as a tribute. Additionally, 
they must prepare the ritual space, which must be a place of 
total isolation, by setting up a circle of obsidian mirrors.

When the character is ready to begin the ritual, they must sit at 
the center of this circle and perform a sacrifice of their chosen 
tribute. Deep within the reflections of the obsidian mirrors, 
the character witnesses the same and similar events occurring 
nearly infinitely before them. Then, over the course of 8 hours, 
the character and their shadows enter into intense negotiations 

226

to determine which of them deserves the power granted by this 
ritual.

At the culmination of this 8 hours, the character must make 
an opposed Personality test against themselves. On a failure, 
the mirrors fade to black, returning the character to total isola-
tion without having achieved their goal. However, this failure 
improves the characters ability to reason with themselves, which 
grants them a cumulative +10 bonus (which only applies to the 
player characters test) for the opposed test on their next attempt.

On a success, each of the infinite shadows that participated in 
this ritual grants them an inconsequential portion of them-
selves, combining to great effect. This grants the character the 
Shadow Magic Elite Advance with Personality as their Governing 
Characteristic once they spend the required XP.

New Trait: Convergence Rating (X)
A character with this trait has the ability to converge alternate 
realities to change their own world through the use of Shadow 
Magic. The X value of the trait, which ranges from 1-10, rep-
resents their raw ability to do so.

Convergence Rating (CR) is the measure of a characters raw 
ability to manipulate shadow: the higher their CR the more 
powerful they will be. CR is measured on a scale of 1-10, and 
is represented by the Convergence Rating (X) trait. CR plays an 
important role in the use of Congruence Powers and Congruence 
Rituals, both abilities that manipulate shadows in order to 
produce certain effects.

Congruence Abilities
Congruence Powers are the result of a shadow mage twisting 
shadows in order to affect the forces that created them. 

Congruence Rituals are similar to Congruence Powers, but they 
require more preparation and focus to utilize. Neither Powers 
or Rituals require magicka. 

Shadow Magic is based entirely within the characters governing 
characteristic, which was determined by which ritual granted 
them the ability. Shadow mages who use their Intelligence can 
intellectually deduce reality down to the circumstances they want 
to occur with such pristine precision that the shadows have no 
choice but to obey. Those who use their Perception have the 
ability to perceive between the cracks of their own universe and 
use or pull out the shadows and alternate occurrences that they 
desire. Lastly, those who use their Personality have the guile to 
convince the shadows to do their bidding.

Using Congruence Abilities
When utilizing either Congruence Powers or Rituals, the shadow 
magician will partition their raw ability to dedicate a portion 
of their power to the power or ritual.

To cast a power or perform a ritual, first, the character must 
decide how much of their Congruence Rating they are commit-
ting (a whole number above 0), then they will roll the Governing 
Characteristic (GC)  granted by their initiation ritual with a 
certain bonus or penalty specified by the power or ritual.
For each point lower the chosen CR is than their maximum CR, 
the character receives a +10 bonus to their GC test. For each 
point higher the chosen CR is than their max CR, the character 
receives a -10 penalty to their GC test.

If the character uses less CR than their maximum and passes 
the test, then the power or ritual succeeds. If, under the same 
circumstance, they fail the test, then the power or ritual fails 
and the character suffers a Minor Disharmony. If the character 
uses more CR than their maximum, and passes the test, then 
the power or ritual succeeds and they automatically trigger a 
Minor Disharmony. If, under the same circumstance, they fail 
the test, then the power or ritual fails and they automatically 
trigger a Major Disharmony.

If the character critically succeeds while making their shadow 
casting test, no disharmonies are triggered regardless of CR 
expenditure. However, if they critically fail, they trigger a major 
disharmony.

If the character is using a congruence power or performing a 
congruence ritual by thought alone, the congruence test suf-
fers a -20 penalty. Using a congruence power or performing a 
congruence ritual with only one hand imposes a -10 penalty 
on the power or ritual test. If the character is performing the 
power or ritual without any hand motions, the power or ritual 
test suffers a -20 penalty. 

Congruence Powers
A character can only use Congruence Powers that they have 
learned. Any character with a Convergence Rating of one or 
higher can learn powers by spending the XP listed with the 
power. While Congruence Powers are considered magic, they do 
not count as spells when considered by other effects, including 
traits or talents.

Each power has a default difficulty associated with it. This bonus/
penalty is used on top of the characters bonus when committing 
CR. For some powers, the default difficulty is also a formula 
based on the duration of the power, which is another variable 
chosen by the caster when the power is used.

minutes.

Activating a Congruence power requires that the character have 
both hands free. For each hand that is not free, the character 
suffers a -20 penalty to the Shadow Magic test. Talents which 
lower these requirements for spellcasting apply to activating 
congruence powers as well.

Blink
The character reaches into the shadows, using them to speed their 
journey through their currents.
Cost: 100 XP
Difficulty: +0
Effect: The character vanishes and reappears at a target loca-
tion within up to (CR*5) meters of their starting location. The 
character must be able to see their target location.

Foreboding
The character is connected to the shadows around them, allowing 
them to see danger coming.
Cost: 75 XP
Difficulty: -20
Effect: As a secondary action, when the character uses this 
power, the next successful attack made against them has its 
DoS reduced by the CR committed when this power was used. 
If this would reduce the attackers degrees of success to zero or 
lower, the attacker counts as having failed the attack test. This 
effect lasts until the characters next long rest.

Vanish
The character hides themselves in the shadows.
Cost: 50 XP
Difficulty: +10
Effect: The character gains the Invisible condition for a number 
of rounds equal to the CR of the power. The condition is lost if 
the character attacks, casts a spell, or activates a power.

Mirror Image
The character twists the shadows around them, presenting multiple 
images of themselves to others.
Cost: 100 XP
Difficulty: +10 - (10 * X)
Effect: The character creates an illusory duplicate of themselves. 
The duplicate emerges from within the character, persists for 
X minutes, and may be controlled as a free action, though it 
moves as normal. It may not move more than CR kilometers 
away from the character and cannot attack targets or interact 
physically with objects or the environment. Other characters 
must pass a Perception test with a -5 penalty for each CR in 
order to determine which of the two images is real (they must 
only make this test when first encountering the duplicate and the 
original together). The character can see through the duplicates 
eyes, hear through its ears, and speak using its mouth.

228

Shadow Weapon
The character bends the shadows to their will, forming a fearsome 
dark weapon.
Cost: 100 XP
Difficulty: -10 - (5 * X)
Effect: Character chooses a duration X. Summons a weapon 
with the type of the casters choice, using the Penumbric weapon 
material specified below to complete the profile. If the weapon 
leaves the characters reach, it vanishes. The weapon may be dis-
missed by the character at will. The item persists for X minutes, 
or until the character who summoned it is killed. Weapons 
summoned using this power always count as being part of the 
characters combat style.
The penumbric weapon material has a +3 Material Bonus. When 
resolving Slashing, Splitting, or Crushing with a penumbric 
weapon the CR of the power is used instead of the characters Str 
bonus. The bonus damage granted from these weapon qualities 
and from the material bonus is resolved as Shadow damage.

Summon Shadow Horror
The character brings forth a creature that lives in the shadows, born 
from the myriad forces that shape them.
Cost: 75 XP
Difficulty: +0
Effect: Character chooses a duration X. Summons a weapon 
with the type of the casters choice, using the Penumbric weapon 
material specified below to complete the profile. If the weapon 
leaves the characters reach, it vanishes. The weapon may be dis-
missed by the character at will. The item persists for X minutes, 
or until the character who summoned it is killed. Weapons 
summoned using this power always count as being part of the 
characters combat style.

A Shadow Horror (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) 
appears within five meters of the caster with the Summoned trait. 
It must obey the commands of the character while it is in this 
plane. The creature persists for 1 minute, or until the character 
who summoned it dies, and then vanishes. Alternatively, the 
character can choose to simply unleash the Shadow Horror. The 
Shadow Horror appears within five meters of the caster: it does 
not obey the characters commands and is hostile to all characters.
The Shadow Horror must immediately make an Opposed 
Willpower test with the caster. If the caster wins the test, the 
Shadow Horror has the Bound trait. If the Shadow Horror 
wins the test, they are not Bound to the caster. During the 
Opposed Willpower test, the caster gains a 5*CR bonus to the 
roll. Keeping the Shadow Horror in line imposes Mindlock (3).

Twist Fortune
The character turns the shadows against their target, and they work 
subtly to foil their every action.
Cost: 50 XP
Difficulty: +10
Effect: The character chooses a single target within (20 times 
CR) meters. If the target fails the opposed test, he is plagued by 
misfortune for CR rounds: constantly tripping over themselves, 
and generally fumbling in everything they do. The exact effects 
are left to the GM.

Congruence Rituals
A character can only use Congruence Rituals that they have 
learned. Any character with a Convergence Rating of one 
or higher can learn rituals by spending XP or CrP. While 
Congruence Rituals may be magic, they do not count as rituals 
for the purposes of other effects.

Each ritual has a Default Difficulty associated with it. This 
bonus/penalty is used on top of the characters bonus when 
committing CR.

Bind Shadow Weapon (30 Minutes)
The character bends the shadows to their will, transforming a 
weapon into a fearsome dark implement and binding it to their 
shadows.
Cost: 75 XP
Difficulty: -30
Effect: The character binds a physical weapon to their shadow. 
They target a specific physical (not summoned) weapon and 
either themself or a willing creature, binding the weapon to 
the target character. When the ritual is completed, the physical 
form of the weapon slips into the target characters shadow, no 
longer existing in its physical form. The target character can 
now summon and unsummon this weapon as a free action at 
will. While summoned, the weapon has the same profile it had 
before it was bound to the character including any modifications 
and enchantments; however, damage from weapon qualities and 
the material bonus is applied as Shadow damage. A character 
cannot have more than one weapon bound to them in this way. 
If the target character already has a weapon bound to them, 
then that weapon ceases to exist and is replaced by the new 
weapon from this ritual.

229

Shadow Portal (10 Hours)
The character shapes the shadows so that he may pass through their 
realms in an instant to cross great distances.
Cost: 75 XP
Difficulty: -20, with an additional -20 penalty if the desired 
destination is in another plane or dimension.
Effect: Creates a portal, within 5 meters of the character, which 
tunnels through the shadows to target location (the location 
can be anywhere the character has visited before, as long as they 
can clearly picture it in their mind).

When the first character passes through the portal, the character 
who created it must make an Intelligence test, the difficulty of 
which is determined by the GM based on how long it has been 
since the character was at the target location, how far away 
the location is, his state of mind when the portal was created, 
other circumstances, and so forth. If he passes this test, then the 
character (and any subsequent ones) who passes through this 
portal arrives at the desired destination instantly. On failure, the 
GM may choose an alternate destination (the nature of which 
is left to their discretion). The character makes this test at a +5 
bonus for each CR.

Anyone passing through the portal must make a Willpower 
test with a -20 penalty or suffer a minor disharmony when 
they emerge (adding their degrees of failure to the result on the 
table). The portal persists for 5 minutes, or until the character 
who created it closes it (which may be done at will, instantly).

Shadow Scry (5 Minutes)
The character peers through the shadows themselves, casting his 
gaze across the world.
Cost: 50 XP
Difficulty: -10
Effect: The character sees events currently happening somewhere 
else: the higher the CR the more the character can control what 
the vision centers on, and the more detail they receive from the 
vision. The vision lasts a number of seconds equal to three times 
the CR of the ritual. This counts as visiting a location for 
the purposes of choosing a target for the Shadow Portal power.

Precognition (30 Minutes)
The character can see the reflection of future events amongst the 
forces that shape the shadows around them.
Cost: 50 XP
Difficulty: +0
Effect: The character sees a vision of their own future hidden 
within the shadows. This vision lasts a number of seconds equal 
to twice the CR of the ritual. The character can look up to CR 
days into their own future while this effect is active. The higher 
the CR, the more the character is able to control what these 
visions focus on (up to GM discretion).

Shadow Gate (1 Hour)
The character binds the shadows, securing an object from prying 
eyes and the fingers of thieves.
Cost: 75 XP
Difficulty: -20
Effect: The character creates an impenetrable shadow gate which 
secures a target door, chest, or other container or portal. This 
shadow gate lasts forever, and can only be opened by a shadow 
key or by the character that created it (with a free action). CR 
cannot be dedicated to this ritual.

Shadow Double (8 Hours)
The character forcibly moves an alternate version of someone from 
another reality to this one. The party in question is usually not 
happy with this arrangement.
Cost: 300 XP
Difficulty: -30, with an additional -20 penalty if the target is 
another character.
Effect: The character being doubled must be chosen as the 
ritual focus, and thus must take part in the ritual. The character 
performing the ritual can choose to double themselves. Forcibly 
pulls an alternate version of the target character into this reality 
with none of their belongings or equipment,. The higher the 
CR, the less divergent from this realitys version of the character 
the alternate version will be. The exact nature of this character 
is left entirely to the GM. The GM has complete control over 
their actions, unless he deems that the character is an exact or 
near exact duplicate of one of the PCs, in which case the player 
in question may control themselves and their double.

The double enters the world in a pure black shadow state 
(though they are fully physical) and slowly gains color and detail 
over an hour as they adapt to this plane. Characters exposed to 
alternate versions of themselves must make a fear test with a 
+20 bonus, and an additional -5 penalty for each CR above 4: 
the more exact the duplicate, the more Traumatizing the effect. 
If the character performing the ritual is duplicating themselves, 
they are exempt from this requirement. If the alternate version 
of the character dies, they return to their realm reset to the 
state they were in when they were removed from it.

230

Shadow Sense
The character has picked up the habit of monitoring the currents of 
the shadows around them, and is able to detect when theyre being 
manipulated.
Journeyman (Prc)
The character can make an Observe skill test in order to detect 
when other characters use congruence powers or rituals within a 
number of kilometers equal to the X value of their Convergence 
Rating (X) trait. On success, their degrees of success determine 
how accurately they can place the location of the other shadow 
mage and determine the nature of the power used.

Harmonic Safeguards
The character is able to fetter their power in such a way as to entirely 
protect himself from Disharmony.
Adept (EA Governing Char.)
If the character dedicates less than or equal to half their maxi-
mum CR (round up), then they cannot trigger Disharmonies 
in any way.

Shadow Walk (10 Minutes)
The character walks through the myriad alternate realities that exist 
within the shadows, entering one of them.
Cost: 100 XP
Difficulty: -20, with an additional -20 penalty to send another 
character.
Effect: The character performing the ritual is the focus for this 
ritual. The target character shadow walks to an alternate reality. 
Their physical body vanishes from this world, and appears in 
another. Given the infinite number of possible realities, choosing 
one specifically is quite rather, as most are indistinguishable. The 
character using the ritual may specify the nature of the target 
reality, and the higher the CR of the ritual the more accurately 
theyre able to choose the reality they enter.

If the character fails the test with degrees of failure less than or 
equal to their Willpower bonus, the ritual still manifests: the 
GM should adjust the effective CR of the ritual (-1 for each 
degree of failure) and then determine the effects based on this 
new CR. The character does not know that they erred in any 
way. Failure with degrees of failure in excess of their Willpower 
bonus means the ritual simply does not manifest its effects.

The only way for a character to return to their original reality 
is to use this ritual to get back, though a CR of 4 is sufficient 
to send the character home due to their connection to their 
original realm.

If this ritual is targeting a character other than the caster, the 
target character must be either willing or helpless.

Talents
Shadow Magic talents improve a characters ability to manipulate 
the shadows through the use of shadow magic.

Sublime Congruence
The character improves their connection to the shadows around 
them, manipulating them for their own gain.
Varies (EA Governing Char.)
The character increases the X value of their Convergence Rating 
(X) trait by one. The character can purchase this talent more 
than once. This talent begins at the Novice level, and gains a 
level each time a character purchases it, to a maximum of Master. 
This talent can be purchased more than once at the master level, 
to a maximum Convergence Rating value of ten.

For the next 10 minutes, all characters seem to see figures, resembling people, lurking in the shadows in the area 
around the character.

For the briefest of moments, all shadows within 50 meters disappear completely, only to return a few seconds later.

A shadow bends around the character, coiling around him like a snake, for 1d4 minutes.

All people within 50 meters feel a shiver run down their spine.

All animals within 100 meters take on a sinister look and begin to behave erratically for 1d4 minutes as shadows 
flock to them.

A single random object within 2d10 meters of the character disappears only to be replaced with something from 
another reality. The trade is completely random, and left to the GM to determine.

All people within line of sight of the character have a trivial memory torn from them forever.

Food and plants within 25 meters begin to rapidly rot away.

All lights within 50 meters go out, smothered by shadows.

For a brief moment (one round), it seems to everyone within 30 meters of the character that night has fallen, 
plunging the area into total darkness.

Mirrors and windows within 25 meters of the character show strange, rippling visions of alternate worlds.

Everyone in sight, including the character, feels a terrible pain in their chest. They gain the stunned condition for 
1 round.

The characters features take on a dark appearance, as the shadows contort his visage into that of a monster. He 
gains the Frightening (-10) trait until the end of the next round.

The character vanishes, only to reappear moments later (at the end of the next round) from within a random 
shadow within 50 meters of his starting position.

Everyone within sight, including the character, loses a Stamina point and notices that their bodies seem to be 
casting more shadows than they should for the next minute.

Shadows begin to bleed from the walls and well up from the ground within 15 meters of the character. If there are 
paintings or statues of people, they appear to be crying shadows. All who witness this must make a Panic test.

The shadows lash out against the disharmony, and all people within sight of the character, including the character 
himself, must pass an Agility test or be knocked prone.

Smothering shadows fill the air, cloaking the area within 30 meters in total darkness for 1d4 rounds. The character 
is thrown 1d10 meters into the air in a random direction by tendrils of shadow.

Shadowing apparitions fill the air within 15 meters of the character, wailing as if tormented. All people witnessing 
this must make a Panic test with a -10 penalty.

Pitch black rifts open in the air within 10 meters of the character, lifting everyone into the air and threatening 
to swallow them into whatever dark dimension they lead to, only to vanish seconds later. Everyone affected falls 
1d10 meters.

Shadows contort violently around the character, releasing a deafening shriek that can be heard up to a kilometer 
away. This shriek shatters glass, and forces everyone to make an Endurance test or become deafened for 1d10 
rounds.

The characters own shadow grabs him and thrashes him around violently for 1d4 rounds, he must make an 
Endurance test or lose 1d4 Stamina Points.

For a split second the world changes appearance, and everyone within 50 meters gets a glimpse of the countless 
terrifying realities that lie beyond the veil of shadows. All affected characters must make a Panic test with a -20 
penalty.

All light sources, magical or otherwise, within 50 meters go out. No light can penetrate the area within 15 meters 
of the character for 1d10 rounds.

All characters within 20 meters, excluding the character, gain the Frenzied condition as their alternate selves bleed 
through from beyond the veil of shadows.

The character causes a major disharmony: roll on the major-disharmony table (adding the CR of the power).

Major Disharmonies

Effect

The characters shadow begins to scream as visions of uncountable realities flash before the characters eyes only to be forgot-
ten a moment later. The character must make a Panic (-20) test.

Baleful shadows course through the character, inflicting torment upon him. The character must make an Endurance test or 
gain the stunned condition for DoF rounds.

Visions of alternate realities bleed through into this one. The characters friends and foes appear to them to be terrible 
monsters of shadow. The effect lasts 1d4 rounds and they must make a Panic test with a -30 penalty.

A specter of darkness appears, cursing the character for his hubris, and strikes him down with ice cold tendrils of shadow. He 
takes 1d10 frost damage to a random hit location.

The character completely loses control of the shadows around him, and they lash out at his mind. He cannot use any other 
congruence powers for the next 1d4 hours.

The characters mind is whisked away to another reality, leaving them unconscious. At the beginning of each round they may 
test Willpower to attempt to return to reality, but if they fail with degrees of failure beyond their Willpower bonus, his mind 
is lost forever.

The shadows strike back at the character, and turn his power against him. Redirect the power that caused this Disharmony 
against the character. If such a thing isnt possible, the character takes 1d8 damage to a random hit location, bypassing armor, 
natural toughness, and resistances.

Dark beings appear from all shadows within 20 meters, whispering the unfathomable secrets of other realities to anyone 
unlucky enough to hear them. Everyone affected must make a Horror (+0) test.

A random person within 50 meters is suddenly swapped with another version of themselves from an alternate reality. This 
effect only ends when the intruder is slain, or after five minutes when the original returns (though the double might still be 
around!). The character returns with the dazed condition for 1d10 rounds.

A wild and dangerous Shadow Horror (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) pops into existence within 15 meters of 
the character, and persists for 1 minute  or until it is slain. It detests the character, and will attack him whenever possible.

All characters within 50 meters take 2d6 damage that ignores armor, natural toughness, and resistances as they are assaulted 
by their own shadows.

All shadows within 25 meters reveal their true forms, showing the myriad possibilities of other realities. All characters 
witnessing this must make a Horror (-20) test. This effect lasts 1d4 rounds, and characters must make the test each round 
they are exposed until they fail one (though they can close their eyes to avoid it). All shadow magic powers used in the area 
automatically cause a minor disharmony.

The character blinks out of existence for 1 round, returning with none of his belongings, and a broken mess of a body. He 
takes 2d6 damage that ignores armor, and appears to have suffered years of torture. He is mentally and physically scarred by 
the ordeal.

Each character within 100 meters suffers from a distorted perception of reality, as shadows shift and present false visions, or 
visions of another world, to them. Each round for 2d10 rounds, everyone affected must make a Willpower test or succumb 
to this new reality. What this entails is left to the GM.

A Sliver of UmbraKeth (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) appears within 30 meters of the character. Its sole 
purpose is to kill the character or be destroyed in the attempt.

The character sinks into the darkness of their own shadow until they are completely gone. Once inside whatever alternate 
reality they have been pulled into, they must make a test using their shadow magic Governing Characteristic with a -50 
penalty. On success, they have a chance to find their way back, though this takes time (either play a short session for the 
player later, or simply rule that they return after 3d10 days, battered and bruised). On failure they are lost forever.

The characters own shadow is destroyed, and the shock from losing his link in the middle of manipulating the innumerable 
shadow realms kills him instantly.

A Sliver of UmbraKeth (see the Inhabitants of Tamriel supplement) appears where the character once was, destroying him 
instantly as it explodes from his shadow. It will attack all characters around it until it is brought down.

Encounter Shadow Horrors
Eldritch Beasts which reside in the spaces between realities, 
these shadows-made-flesh are relentlessly aggressive and horri-
fyingly cunning in their own twisted way. They are not of the 
Mundus, or even of the Aurbis, and bring with them a cold 
malice whenever they are brought forth into this world. No two 
Shadow Horrors appear completely identical, often appearing 
as a horrific mixture of monstrous traits melded together into a 
shadowy, almost incorporeal form. No matter their exact form, 
they are truly dangerous abominations that can kill even the 
most experienced Shadow Magicians.

Shadow Horrors do not appear naturally on Tamriel and GMs 
should consider whether-or-not they truly belong at their table 
before introducing them. If there is no connection between your 
campaign and Shadow Magic, it is likely best to leave them out 
of things. These creatures can only enter the Mundus via two 
ways; as a summon for a Shadow Magician or as part of some 
accident caused by a Shadow Magician. They are strong and have 
access to powerful abilities, meaning that only well-equipped 
and experienced parties can deal with them effectively.

Loot
  Upon defeat the Shadow Horror is banished back to 

the realm-between-realms from whence it came, leaving 
behind a viscous inky-black residue where it fell. On a 
+0 Alchemy test a character with a Vial can attempt to 
collect a single dose of this Shadow Residue, which is 
an Extremely Rare Mysticism and Illusion ingredient. 
On failure the Shadow Residue is contaminated and 
unusable.

past and future, preying upon those unfortunate enough to attract 
their attention.

during the 3rd Era. It took the form of a tall, bipedal, tentacled 
creature with a trunk like a mammoth. Referring to itself as 
the Shadow of Conflict, it was ultimately defeated by a hero 
remembered as the Soul of Conflict by utilizing the legendary 
Star Teeth. Its ultimate goals were unknown, but its influence 
cast a dark shadow over parts of Hammerfell, Skyrim, and 
High Rock.

When it was defeated, it was shattered into many Slivers, each 
possessing a fragment of UmbraKeths vast power. These slivers 
now haunt the realms-between-realms, preying upon any shadow 
mages powerful enough to attract their attention.
A Sliver of UmbraKeth is one of the most powerful creatures 
this system provides for; only Dragons are more deadly. Caution 
should be taken by any GM looking to use these eldritch horrors. 
A Sliver of UmbraKeth should only be encountered when a 
Shadow Mage suffers the appropriate Major Disharmony or 
as a final, greatest foe in a campaign as their powerful abilities 
can make short work of even the most powerful adventurers.

Loot
  Upon defeat the Sliver of UmbraKeth is banished back 
to the realm-between-realms from whence it came, leav-
ing behind a viscous inky-black residue where it fell. On 
a +0 Alchemy test a character with a Vial can attempt to 
collect this residue and form it into a Skein of Conflict, 
which is a Legendary Mysticism and Illusion ingredient. 
On failure the Shadow Residue is contaminated and 
unusable.
